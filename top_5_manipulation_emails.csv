       California Power Crisis Update (No. 10)

      DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK, 3/23/2001

          The weeks highlights include:


      ?   Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible
      remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in
      California and elsewhere (both retroactively and prospectively)
      ?   An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under
      contract is effectively being released into the market at higher
      prices
      ?   A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the
      ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner
      ?   Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts

      Market power


          There are continued indications that the issue of market power
      will not be settled simply.  This week there was a lengthy and
      politically influential front page story in the New York Times about
      FERCs passive approach to policing generators (Critics Say U.S.
      Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities). The story was by
      Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn. (Jeff Gerth's 1992 story on the
      Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of
      what eventually became a multi-year investigation of Bill Clinton.)


          The key issues are familiar:


      ?   Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such
      as price caps, refunds, and so on?
      ?   If so, what is the basis for asserting that market power exists
      and what is the remedy?  (See the discussion in the New York Times
      article on the ""good hours"" vs. ""bad hours"" approach and the
      associated political decision not to deal with ""good hours"").
      ?   Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle
      generator bills in California at something less than 100 cents on the
      dollar.   (The California ISO filed a complaint claiming $6 billion
      in overcharges this week.)

      The QF irony


          Through the 1990s, QF contracts were projected to be the source
      of stranded costs because they were priced ""way above market.""  In
      recent months, in California, they look like a bargain (although some
      are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied
      to gas).  You would think that the utilities would request QFs to
      maximize their output.  But credit problems have created an ironical
      situation.  The facts:


      ?   PG&E and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly
      for some time.
      ?   The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PG&E and
      Edison into bankruptcy. (Some gas-fired QFs had to shut down because
      they did not have money to pay for the gas.)
      ?   Last week's court decision allows MidAmerican/CalEnergy to
      essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract
      ""dedicates"" the output to the purchasing utility.
      ?   CalEnergy does so immediately, selling to El Paso.

      The Reliant Order


          A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO, when
      requested, regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and
      promptly for past deliveries to the ISO.  Reliant announced it will
      appeal the order.


          This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that
      the circumstances governing the 2 situations are probably different.
      The QF contracts pre-date the ISO and are with the utilities and most
      likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies.  In
      fact, many QF contracts have the opposite provision: authority for
      the utility to cut takes during so-called ""light load"" periods.


      Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts--again


          There was another Stage 3 emergency in California ? with rolling
      blackouts this week.  This prompted everyone to wonder why this was
      happening in March.  Among the factors:


      ?   Increased demand from summer-like temperatures
      ?   Cutbacks in imports
      ?   Loss of 1400 MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant
      ?   Loss of about 3100 MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown
      because they could not afford gas bills  (VV)

      Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities
      By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN
      03/23/2001
      The New York Times
      Page 1, Column 1
      c. 2001 New York Times Company

      WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The pressure was intense when federal
      regulators met
      privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity
      prices in
      California.
      Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency
      whose mandate
      is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide,
      had evidence
      that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at
      prices far
      above the cost of generating it. The agency faced an imminent
      deadline to
      challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds
      of millions
      of dollars in unfair profits.

      An internal memorandum laid out two choices. The agency could audit
      and punish
      ''bad actors,'' the companies that were exploiting the market. Or it
      could
      identify ''bad hours,'' when electricity shortages were most acute
      and spiking
      prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the
      most
      exorbitant prices.
      ''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors,'' the
      memorandum said.

      The commission took the easier way. It decided not to investigate
      reports of
      abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to
      refund to
      the state utilities up to $124 million collected during a relatively
      few ''bad
      hours'' in January and February. That is hundreds of millions of
      dollars less
      than California might have claimed, since the most potential
      overcharging
      occurred during ''good hours,'' when power was more plentiful but
      prices were
      often just as extreme. The order ignored those hours.
      Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness,
      California
      regulators estimated that generators had charged $6.2 billion above
      competitive
      levels over 10 months. They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it
      would
      demand more refunds or other stiff remedies. But the agency's track
      record --
      one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves
      California
      regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power
      producers.
      The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union
      Station here,
      has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top
      cop, even
      though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line. To keep
      rates
      reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to
      charge
      market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend
      deregulation altogether.
      Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry
      open the
      $250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been
      controlled by
      monopoly utilities and state officials. The agency's defenders,
      including its
      chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets,
      say that its
      largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of
      competing
      interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling
      market forces.

      But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local
      regulators say
      California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices
      are the signs
      of a market running amok. They accuse the agency of standing aside as
      companies
      manipulate their way to windfall profits. The agency's critics, who
      include one
      of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its
      enforcement
      mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of
      industry
      insiders in its ranks.
      When the agency began its first national investigation of high
      electricity
      prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott
      Miller, to
      lead the effort. Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report
      that there
      was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by
      generating
      companies. Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at
      the time a
      subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department
      that
      focused on electricity market abuses in New England.
      The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local
      power
      markets. Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be
      more
      aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused
      their power in
      California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have
      frequently
      been ignored or rebuffed.
      Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or
      willing to
      make sure the markets worked effectively. They accuse it of showing
      favoritism
      to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore
      requirements to file
      detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving
      accusations
      of market abuses.
      ''We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market
      that is
      being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it,'' said
      William
      Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its
      leading critics.
      The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to ''gaming'' --
      jockeying for
      profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright
      market
      manipulation. Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying
      billions of
      dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly
      competitive.
      Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb
      gaming and
      manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years. But they
      defended
      their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep
      markets free of
      abuse. They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to
      refund
      almost $11 million for possibly manipulating the California market
      last spring.
      Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived
      deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising
      natural gas
      prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity
      prices than
      abuses by companies or any failings by the agency. They say the
      agency must
      balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and
      utility
      companies if it is to keep deregulation on track.
      ''We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop
      a market,
      but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers,''
      Mr. Hebert
      said.
      Fight Over Deregulation
      Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D.
      Roosevelt
      backed legislation to break up utility monopolies. The Federal Power
      Act of 1935
      gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and
      reasonable''
      electricity rates. The Federal Power Commission was abolished in 1977
      and
      replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent
      agency with
      1,200 employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas
      market. The
      president appoints the chairman and four commissioners -- two
      Democrats and two
      Republicans with staggered terms of five years. Two Republican seats
      are
      currently unfilled.
      The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's,
      after the
      agency had begun opening the gas markets. By 1996, the commissioners
      issued a
      landmark order that forced utility companies to open their
      transmission lines to
      other utilities and electricity wholesalers. The commission and many
      private
      economists expected that by prying open protected markets,
      electricity prices
      would immediately fall.
      That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in
      California,
      New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states. Generating
      companies rushed
      to expand in the new, borderless market.
      But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as
      electricity
      deregulation has spread nationwide. Congress has forced it to trim
      its staff in
      recent years. Officials complain that investigating abuses in
      electricity
      markets strains their resources.
      And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have
      begun sparring
      publicly among themselves about what to do. This week, Mr. Massey, a
      Democratic
      commissioner, and Mr. Hebert (pronounced AY-bear), a Republican, sat
      side by
      side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions.
      Mr. Hebert
      said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to
      get supply
      there.'' Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging
      ''unlawful''
      and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not
      doing its
      job.''
      The agency's leadership has been in flux for months. Congressional
      and industry
      officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing
      Mr. Hebert,
      whom he named to the top post less than two months ago, with Pat
      Wood, who runs
      the Texas public utility commission. A White House spokeswoman had no
      comment on
      the reports.
      Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush
      administration,
      his relations with California leaders may have made his position
      tenuous. Mr.
      Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority
      leader, Trent
      Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new
      solutions to
      the crisis there.
      Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often
      taken the
      most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner. He
      flatly rejects
      the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and
      contrary to
      market forces. When Gov. Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state
      buy
      transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's
      response was
      dismissive. ''It's not in the interest of the American public,'' he
      pronounced.
      Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they
      started
      producing nasty shocks. The mid-Atlantic region experienced some
      early
      volatility.
      As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a
      phenomenon
      called ''market power,'' the ability of energy traders in the new
      national
      market to sustain prices above the competitive level. Proving such
      abuses is
      difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of
      separate
      electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that
      initiated them.
      Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit
      entity
      that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power
      companies
      there had exercised some market power. But only the Federal Energy
      Regulatory
      Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the
      data to
      determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had
      been
      abusive or not, he said.
      Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so. In the
      end, Mr.
      Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to
      investigate.
      The decision roiled some agency officials.
      Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June
      describing
      the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure
      competitive electric power markets.'' The staff, the memorandum said,
      did not
      even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed
      quarterly reports
      listing essentially every sale they make. Such data would have been
      useful to
      Mr. Bowring.
      Local-Federal Clash
      Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to
      act on
      their own. Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times
      since 1999 to
      correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by
      market
      manipulation.
      The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too
      much.
      The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view. One vocal critic
      was Mr.
      Miller. Before the agency recruited him last July to head its
      division of energy
      markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national
      energy-trading
      unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets
      also
      include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility.
      Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's
      crisis,
      Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new
      energy
      traders nationwide. PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now
      the
      second-largest seller of electricity in New England.
      The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators. They
      intervened
      several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they
      said
      produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies. Mr. Miller
      denounced
      the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his
      company
      sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could.
      ''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive
      advantage,''
      Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999.
      New
      England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner''
      when
      overseeing the market, he said.
      One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal
      agency got a
      chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators'
      perspective. Their
      Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to
      technical and
      regulatory flaws.
      As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice
      Department, whose
      threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far
      higher than the
      agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England
      pointed to
      unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the
      department during
      that inquiry said.
      One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in
      one of New
      England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the
      department said.
      They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other
      companies
      tried to corner that market for several months early last year. PG&E
      confirmed
      that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing
      and says it
      has cooperated with the department's requests.
      Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the
      agency. His
      supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict
      of interest
      between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency.
      Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August. With
      electricity
      prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several
      utility
      executives at the agency's San Francisco office.
      One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern
      California
      Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market
      abuses by power
      generators. He provided a road map to help investigators figure out
      how power
      companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated
      the
      markets.
      But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and
      marketers --
      including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their
      way. They
      asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your
      strategy
      for bidding generation resources into market.''
      This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent
      to asking
      a suspected burglar how he spent his day.''
      Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper. Mr.
      Rattey
      recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that
      marketers
      were supposed to file. But his suggestion was not adopted, agency
      records show.
      Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said ''there might have been
      more
      information that could have been obtained'' in the California
      inquiry. But he
      said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish,
      making it
      impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved.
      For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so
      time-consuming
      that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form
      required of new
      federal employees. Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January,
      after a
      reporter requested it. Agency lawyers approved the form, but only
      after he
      provided additional information about his job and compensation from
      PG&E. The
      lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because
      PG&E was
      not the subject of the investigation.
      When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and
      problems in
      the design of the California market. But while the companies ''had
      the potential
      to exercise market power,'' the commission said, there was
      ''insufficient data''
      to prove that they did.
      Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration.
      ''This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and
      nobody has
      found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering,'' Rob
      Doty, the
      chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this
      year.
      California Inquiry
      The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on
      generators.
      But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain
      turf.
      When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission
      issued a
      refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high
      prices. It
      required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity
      in
      California for more than $150 per megawatt hour, considered at the
      time a fair
      estimate of the highest costs any of them faced.
      It also told generators that for the next several months, they could
      be forced
      to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive
      prices. The
      commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and
      strategies for
      withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to
      artificially raise
      prices.
      When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in
      January
      approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made
      any
      detailed examination. Instead, staff members said, the agency
      scrambled to forge
      a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement
      opposing high
      prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation.
      During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested
      focusing on
      bad hours instead of bad actors.
      ''Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by
      sellers ('bad
      actors') always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said. It said that
      the agency
      could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the
      most critical
      hours.
      The suggestion won the day. The commission decided to limit its order
      to the
      hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are
      critically
      low.
      Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector
      economists
      have attacked the economic logic of that order. They said that the
      commission
      has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high. The
      bigger worry:
      Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when
      supplies are
      not as tight, they say.
      Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision
      for those
      reasons. Because most high-priced transactions in January and
      February did not
      occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose
      to bless as
      ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from
      the
      California crisis.
      ''The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the
      rhetoric of
      markets that we've gotten sloppy,'' Mr. Massey said. ''We're talking
      about
      electricity. It's the juice of the economy, so it's got to be
      available and
      reasonably priced.''


      Williams defends pricing of electricity

      TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Williams Cos. Inc. says it can justify the rates
      it charged
      for wholesale power, despite accusations from federal regulators that
      it sold
      over-priced electricity to California.
      Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co., a
      unit of
      Tulsa-based Williams, owes California more than $40 million in
      refunds for power
      it sold to the state's Independent System Operator.

      The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of
      several
      power providers responsible for $124 million in overcharges from
      transactions in
      January and February.
      The Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
      grid, claims
      the state was overcharged $6.2 billion by 21 wholesale power
      providers,
      including Williams, between May and February.
      Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were
      based on
      production costs and market conditions.
      ""Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines
      established by
      the ISO,"" said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins. ""We felt like
      we had
      worked within the regulations set up by ISO.""
      According to the commission, power prices levied by Williams in
      January and
      February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural
      gas and
      other market conditions.
      However, the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted
      Williams'
      power prices, Collins said.
      The commission will review Williams' explanation and either accept
      the
      justification or order the company to pay refunds.



      Allegheny Energy makes big California connection

      Associated Press Newswires
      Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has
      agreed to sell
      $4.5 billion worth of power to California's electricity-purchasing
      agency over
      the next 10 years.
      The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to
      1,000
      megawatts that the Hagerstown-based company has secured from western
      generating
      plants through its new energy trading division, Allegheny Energy
      Global Markets
      - formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets.

      ""This is a win-win for both the state of California and Allegheny
      Energy. It
      provides a long-term source of fixed-price energy and should help to
      stabilize
      prices in California,"" said Michael P. Morrell, president of the
      Allegheny
      Energy Supply division.
      Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which delivers
      electric
      energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
      Virginia and
      West Virginia.


      Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif.
      03/23/2001
      Associated Press Newswires

      SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Williams Cos. plans to expands its Kern
      River
      pipeline, which runs through Utah, to provide more natural gas for
      generating
      plants in California.
      Williams' gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it
      plans to
      construct nearly 700 miles of additional pipeline that will run
      parallel to its
      existing Kern River line.

      Construction on the $1 billion project is expected to begin next year
      and is
      scheduled for completion in May 2003, said Kirk Morgan, director of
      business
      development for Kern River pipeline.
      ""Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky
      Mountain basin,
      where producers are aggressively stepping up production,"" Morgan
      said.
      The new pipeline is expected to deliver about 900 million cubic feet
      of natural
      gas per day to markets in Utah, Nevada and California.
      Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in
      California. If all
      of the pipeline's capacity were used to generate electricity, it
      could produce
      about 5,400 megawatts. ""That is enough to light around 4.5 million
      homes,""
      Morgan said.
      The original Kern River line was completed in 1992. It enters Utah
      from Wyoming
      then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful. It turns south
      near the
      Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the
      state before
      passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield, Calif.
      It currently transports 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per
      day. Williams,
      based in Tulsa, Okla., recently filed an emergency application with
      federal
      regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to
      increase its
      capacity by 135 million cubic feet per day. That $81 million pumping
      station
      project should be completed by July 1.
      During the 2002 construction period, the Kern River project will
      employ between
      1,500 and 1,800 people. The company estimates annual property taxes
      it pays to
      Utah counties will increase from $3.5 million to about $7 million.
      Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline, Morgan
      said.
      The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities,
      including
      St. George and Cedar City.
      ""Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full capacity so this
      is an
      opportunity to transport additional gas into those areas from
      company-owned
      supplies in Wyoming,"" said Questar Gas spokeswoman Audra Sorensen.



      Calif Energy Commission OKs 3 Pwr Plants Worth 2,076 MW

      (This article was originally published Thursday)

      LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission Wednesday
      approved
      three power plants worth 2,076 megawatts, two of which are scheduled
      to come on
      line by the end of 2002, a CEC spokesman said Thursday.

      The plants approved include BP Amoco PLC (BP) unit ARCO Western
      Energy's 500
      megawatt Western Midway Sunset Project, slated to come on line in
      October 2002;
      Caithness Energy's 520 MW Blythe Power Plant, to come on line by Dec.
      31, 2002;
      and Thermo Ecotek's 1,056 MW Mountainview Power Plant, scheduled to
      come on line
      in April 2003.
      All three of the new plants will be natural gas-fired combined-cycle
      plants.
      The $550 million Mountainview plant will be located in Southern
      California, near
      San Bernadino. The $300 million Western Midway-Sunset plant will be
      located in
      central Kern County, while the $250 million Blythe plant will be
      located in the
      city of Blythe in Riverside County.
      The latest approvals bring to 13 the total number of plants approved
      since April
      1999 by the CEC, a spokesman said. Those plants will supply 8,405 MW
      to the
      state, which has seen rolling blackouts and spiking wholesale power
      prices in
      the last six months, in part due to lack of supply.

      Some CalEnergy Power Could Be Sold Outside Calif - CEO
      03/23/2001
      Dow Jones Energy Service
      (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

      (This article was originally published Thursday)

      LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Some of CalEnergy Operating Corp's power
      could end up
      being sold outside of California, though that is not the company's
      intent,
      CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call
      Thursday.

      CalEnergy, an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, which is
      majority
      owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway (BRKA), was given legal
      authority
      Thursday to suspend 270 megawatts of power delivery to Edison
      International
      (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market,
      because
      SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November.
      CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following
      the court
      ruling.
      ""We stopped supplying power at 1 PM (PST) and have been selling to
      parties that
      will pay since then....We are selling it to marketers; our current
      marketing
      agent is El Paso Corp (EPG) and they will sell it for us,"" Sokol
      said.
      Sokol added that while it was his company's intention to have its
      power sold to
      California, that could not be guaranteed.
      ""We leave the energy selling to El Paso....We've directed them that
      we would
      like the power to stay in California but we can't stop them,"" from
      selling out
      of state, Sokol said.
      Wholesale prices on the open market are about $400-$500 a
      megawatt-hour, three
      times more than what the company had received under its contract with
      SoCal Ed.
      The court's ruling did not address the $45 million SoCal Ed still
      owes CalEnergy
      for November and December power, and Sokol said that his company's
      separate
      lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utility's assets as
      payment for that
      debt.
      Sokol said the court's ruling had ""significant implications"" for the
      entire
      community of small, independent generators, known as qualifying
      facilities or
      QFs, who have not received payment from SoCal Ed.
      ""Edison's own lawyer said it best....that every QF in the state will
      begin to
      mitigate if the judge allowed us (to sell on the open market),"" Sokol
      said.
      Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary
      bankruptcy
      Friday if CalEnergy hadn't won the case, but said he couldn't
      speculate whether
      other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the
      court
      outcome.
      A group of renewable power suppliers, owed more than $100 million
      from SoCal Ed,
      said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for
      their supply
      contracts with PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and SoCal
      Ed until
      the utilities are restored to financial stability.
      The utilities claim close to $13 billion in undercollections due to
      an inability
      to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze.
      In a statement, SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergy's bid to suspend
      its QF
      contract because the utility believed Gov. Gray Davis and state
      regulators are
      close to resolving ""very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy
      and other QF
      suppliers.""
      SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergy's request to sell to
      third parties
      would lead to a major supply shortage in California.
      The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to
      resolve the issue
      without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors.
      While many of the state's large power suppliers have been paid by on
      a forward
      basis for the power they sell into California, the QFs, which make up
      one-third
      of the state's total power supply, haven't been paid by SoCal Ed
      since November.
      PG&E has made partial payments to its QFs.

      California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract
      KEN ELLINGWOOD; DAN MORAIN
      TIMES STAFF WRITERS

      Los Angeles Times
      Home Edition

      Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

      El CENTRO -- California's balance of electrical power shifted
      slightly Thursday
      when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal
      energy
      producer from its contract with Southern California Edison, allowing
      it to sell
      power on the open market.
      The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly could lead to a
      mass exodus
      by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to
      the
      state's financially troubled utilities for months without getting
      paid.

      At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the
      small
      generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as
      today.
      In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in
      the state
      Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to
      ensure that
      the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on
      behalf of
      Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cash and
      credit to
      purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the
      small,
      alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a third
      of the
      state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it, saying
      it hadn't
      been given sufficient scrutiny.
      The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,
      where
      Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property
      taxpayer, had
      outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on notice
      that it was
      about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The uncertainty
      had prompted
      the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue
      for badly
      needed school repairs.
      Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's
      ruling
      Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J.
      Leimgruber that the
      company would pay its property taxes on time.
      ""That is great news,"" Leimgruber said.
      Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting
      geothermal
      power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a marketing
      company that
      purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot
      market.
      Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state
      said they
      were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &
      Electric.
      ""We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,"" said Dean
      Vanech,
      president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small
      gas-fired
      plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by
      Edison.
      Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply
      wanted the
      authority to sell its power ""to a credit-worthy company that, in
      fact, pays for
      the power.""
      An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the
      ruling, but
      sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because
      ""California's power
      crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as it has placed
      utilities
      in financial distress.""
      Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and
      other small
      producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnergy had
      specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain
      in
      California, ""but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state,
      we can't
      stop them.""
      Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the
      company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to
      file a
      petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the
      utility
      into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to
      do so, and
      he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would
      shelve their
      plans.
      Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange
      Commission
      showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity
      producers, many
      of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam,
      solar energy
      or wind.
      The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected
      to the
      legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling
      out how the
      utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the
      Senate on a
      27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled in
      the Assembly
      on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds.
      ""When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about
      pieces of
      legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cut
      and pasted
      together and were rammed through by the Legislature,"" Assemblyman
      George Runner
      (R-Lancaster) said. ""That's exactly what we have before us.""
      The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies,
      warned that
      they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives
      of Edison
      and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy
      crisis,
      said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole.
      ""There isn't enough money,"" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a
      Senate
      hearing on the bill Thursday. ""It is a very simple question: Dollars
      going out
      cannot be greater than dollars coming in.""
      The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to
      clarify earlier
      legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state
      all money
      collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been
      buying.
      Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public
      Utilities
      Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy
      producers for
      their electricity.
      Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices
      offered by the
      administration. But most of the alternative energy producers,
      including Chevron
      and British Petroleum, use natural gas to generate electricity
      through
      ""cogeneration,"" a process of creating steam for both electric
      generation and
      heat. With natural gas prices high, they contend, they would lose
      money at the
      prices Davis is offering.

      Power Points
      Background
      The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a
      unanimous vote in
      1996. The move was expected to lower power bills in California by
      opening up the
      energy market to competition. Relatively few companies, however,
      entered that
      market to sell electricity, giving each that did considerable
      influence over the
      price. Meanwhile, demand has increased in recent years while no major
      power
      plants have been built. These factors combined last year to push up
      the
      wholesale cost of electricity. But the state's biggest
      utilities--Pacific Gas &
      Electric and Southern California Edison--are barred from increasing
      consumer
      rates. So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt
      and,
      despite help from the state, have struggled to buy enough
      electricity.
      *
      Daily Developments
      * Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at $6.3
      billion, up
      from the $5.5 billion first thought, California's power grid operator
      said.
      * Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued
      that
      Cal-ISO's figures don't take into account all their costs.
      * A Superior Court judge's ruling Thursday freeing a small producer
      from its
      contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy
      producers that
      have been selling to the utilities without getting paid.

      Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power

      California's electric-grid operator said power suppliers may have
      overcharged
      the state and its utilities by $6.2 billion, or a total of 30%, in a
      10-month
      period, and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of
      electricity markets.
      Meanwhile, a California state judge handed down a decision involving
      small power
      producers that could result in more electricity being made available
      in the
      energy-starved state, but likely at greater cost to the state
      government.

      The $6.2 billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the
      California
      Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy
      Regulatory
      Commission. The ISO says it isn't seeking a refund -- for the May
      through
      February period -- because its analysis lacked important market data.
      For example, it estimated costs for 21 suppliers based on published
      prices for
      natural gas, not on specific data showing what each generator
      actually paid for
      the fuel. ""We don't know how much gas actually was purchased at
      spot-market
      prices,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's head of market analysis.
      Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO, said FERC needs to
      become ""more
      aggressive about market-power mitigation."" The ISO's filing, he said,
      was
      intended to push the agency in that direction, since FERC is
      responsible for
      policing deregulated electricity and natural-gas markets.
      He said that if the FERC doesn't act, the state of California may
      find ways to
      discipline the market, such as through the state attorney general's
      office. The
      attorney general has been investigating the state's electricity
      market for many
      months but hasn't brought any court action.
      Dynegy Inc., a big owner of power plants in California, said it will
      provide
      additional information to FERC supporting its position that the
      prices it has
      charged for power have been ""just and reasonable."" The Houston
      company was one
      of 13 energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay
      refunds totaling
      $124 million or ""show cause"" why it should be excused. Dynegy said
      the FERC
      analysis was flawed, because it used ""inaccurate"" prices for natural
      gas and
      pollution credits.
      While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack, small
      power
      producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in
      Southern
      California's Imperial County. A judge granted 10 geothermal plants
      operated by
      the CalEnergy Co. unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., a unit of
      Berkshire
      Hathaway Inc., of Omaha, Neb., permission to suspend deliveries of
      electricity
      to Southern California Edison Co. and instead seek other buyers.
      These plants, known as ""qualifying facilities,"" are under long-term
      contract to
      Edison and other utilities but haven't been paid for months. Edison,
      a unit of
      Edison International, of Rosemead, Calif., says it has been unable to
      pay
      hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and
      others because
      it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the state's failed
      utility-deregulation plan.
      While the CalEnergy case involves only about 320 megawatts of power,
      the
      repercussions could be far greater. Collectively, hundreds of
      qualifying
      facilities, or QFs, produce as much as 30% of California's
      electricity needs.
      QFs totaling 3,000 megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for
      lack of
      payment. This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts
      that hit
      California this week.
      Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs
      an
      opportunity to sell power in the open market, presumably to the state
      government
      that now is California's biggest energy buyer. An hour after the
      court decision
      yesterday, some 400 megawatts of power came back into the market, the
      ISO said.
      However, additional QF power sales on the open market could
      substantially
      increase the state's tab. Already, the state has allocated more than
      $4 billion
      for electricity purchases.
      Separately, Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
      filing that its
      unpaid power bills could contribute to a write-off of as much as $2.7
      billion
      for 2000. Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis, the
      company hasn't
      yet reported year-end earnings.



      Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts
      By KAREN GAUDETTE
      Associated Press Writer
      03/22/2001
      Associated Press Newswires

      SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators said Thursday they are
      working to
      exempt all California hospitals, regardless of size, from rolling
      blackouts.
      The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from
      hospitals and
      investor-owned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed
      an emergency
      motion with the PUC on behalf of more than 500 hospitals throughout
      the state.

      Under PUC rules, hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from
      losing
      electricity during power emergencies. But during rolling blackouts
      Monday, at
      least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to
      use their
      backup generators.
      Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. say
      they blacked
      out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators.
      Both
      utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall
      efforts to
      spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers.
      Linda Ziegler, director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal
      Edison,
      said the utility is following state law and will implement new
      guidelines if the
      PUC changes them.
      But hospitals say there is a 10-second lapse before emergency
      generators kick
      in, which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical
      procedures such
      as organ transplants or brain surgery.
      ""You wouldn't fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in
      place,""
      said Ann Mosher, a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center
      in San
      Francisco. ""Backup generators are just that, they're not designed to
      keep the
      hospital up and running at full capacity.""
      Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy
      crisis,
      from incidents like lightning or a knocked-down power pole.
      ""If it's a serious problem for the hospital it's certainly something
      they should
      be address just from an ongoing basis,"" she said.
      The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the
      state's
      investor owned utilities PG&E, Southern California Edison and San
      Diego Gas and
      Electric.
      Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities, such as
      the Los
      Angeles Department of Water and Power, are separately regulated.
      For more than two decades, prisons, hospitals with more than 100 beds
      and
      emergency services such as fire and police departments have been
      classified as
      ""essential"" services, and are exempted from blackouts by order of
      state power
      regulators.
      After rolling blackouts began darkening the state in January, many
      other public
      service groups began seeking relief from power interruptions,
      including transit
      systems, schools and water districts.

      Federal Judge Orders Reliant To Keep Selling Pwr To Calif
      03/22/2001
      Dow Jones Energy Service
      (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

      SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)--A federal judge issued a preliminary
      injunction
      Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling
      to
      California despite its fear that it will not get paid.
      U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at
      risk of
      irreparable harm if Reliant Energy (REI) stopped selling power to the
      Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid.
      The ISO buys
      last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply.

      Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of
      Water
      Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest
      utilities. The
      state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific
      Gas and
      Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by
      suppliers
      after amassing billions of dollars in debts.
      The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that
      power.
      Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing
      the costly
      last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
      authorizing state
      power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
      ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators ""a
      tool to
      assist them in keeping the lights on in California.""
      ""Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other
      generators to
      simply ignore emergency orders,"" Robinson said.
      Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the
      Federal Energy
      Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
      Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against
      three other
      wholesalers - Dynegy Inc. (DYN), AES Corp. (AES) and Williams Cos.
      (WMB) - which
      agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.
      Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the
      office Wednesday
      night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press
      seeking
      comment on the ruling.
      The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order
      requiring the
      power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining
      order,
      requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to
      continue sales
      to California pending his Wednesday ruling.
      The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers
      pulled out,
      enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough
      for
      roughly 750 homes.
      Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts.
      Reliant said
      the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because
      most of its
      output is already committed under long-term contracts.
      Reliant, which currently provides about 9% of the state's power,
      worries it
      won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison. PG&E
      and Edison
      say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June due to
      soaring
      wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law
      bars them
      from passing onto customers.


      Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped
      By Jason Leopold
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
      03/22/2001
      Dow Jones Energy Service
      (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

      LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Many of California's independent power
      producers late
      Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this
      week if state
      lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators
      charge for
      electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned
      utilities.
      At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public
      Utilities
      Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities'
      electricity rates to
      the monthly border price of natural gas.

      Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation.
      State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would
      restructure
      the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific
      Gas &
      Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison,
      and Sempra
      Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric from $170 a megawatt-hour
      to
      $69-$79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas.
      Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because
      natural gas
      prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California,
      the state
      wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities.
      The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of
      electricity
      in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new
      supply
      contracts with the utilities.
      ""For $79/MWh, natural gas would have to be $6 per million British
      thermal unit
      at
 the Southern California border,"" said Tom Lu, executive director
      of
      Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF,
      generating 340
      MW. ""Our current gas price at the border is $12.50.""
      Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of
      rolling blackouts
      if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is
      expected to be
      heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be implemented by
      Public
      Utilities Commission next week.
      Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC (BP) and is owed $100
      million by
      SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature ""will
      only make
      things worse.""
      David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association,
      whose members
      supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to
      pay the
      QFs more than $1 billion for electricity that was already produced.
      State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons


      The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total
      power
      supply. Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired
      facilities. The rest
      is generated by wind, solar power and biomass.
      About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in
      California
      because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of millions
      of dollars
      from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly four
      months.
      Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have
      threatened to drag
      the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to
      default on
      payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates.
      The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable
      to operate
      their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural
      gas to run
      their units. Others continue to produce electricity under their
      contracts with
      the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward basis.
      The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's
      electricity
      grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason
      rolling
      blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday.
      Gov. Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs
      took their
      units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and
      Tuesday to
      try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a
      forward basis
      and set rates of $79/MWh and $69/MWh for five and 10 year contracts.
      He also
      said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs
      for power
      they sell going forward.
      ""After next week the QF problem will be behind us,"" Davis said
      Tuesday. ""We want
      to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that
      happens
      the lights go out.""
      But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez,
      D-Shafter,
      a member of the Assembly energy committee.
      ""I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on,"" Florez said in
      an
      interview. ""Many of these congenerators are in my district. They said
      if the
      legislation doesn't change they are going offline. This compounds the
      issue of
      rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt.""
      Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was
      handing the
      QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that
      would have
      set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign
      individual
      contracts with the utilities. In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the
      legislation,
      saying the rates should be below $50/MWh.
      Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to
      the new
      rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was
      originally
      proposed.
      QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts


      John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee,
      one of a
      handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options
      on getting
      paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want
      to be
      released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties.
      ""Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third
      parties
      (including the state Department of Water Resources) until a
      resolution to the
      crisis can be accomplished,"" wood said.
      Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in
      Sacramento,
      which is owed $8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation
      units
      offline.
      Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business.
      ""I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this
      decision,"" he said.
      ""The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to
      raise
      electricity rates. All of this is being driven by an artificial
      construct that
      California can avoid raising rates.""

      Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount Energy: Officials say summer
      prices will be high, and a state report shows that contracts with
      generators are far short of goals.
      DAN MORAIN; JENIFER WARREN
      TIMES STAFF WRITERS
      03/22/2001
      Los Angeles Times
      Home Edition
      A-3
      Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

      SACRAMENTO -- California's fragile electricity system stabilized
      Wednesday, but
      a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the
      state could
      be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the
      costly and
      volatile spot market.
      After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been
      shut down were
      cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the
      statewide power
      grid relaxed their state of emergency.

      But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained
      shut down,
      skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them.
      State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the
      high cost of
      the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will
      block an
      administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an account
      that could
      be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity.
      And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between
      Davis and
      independent power generators showed that the state has signed
      contracts for only
      2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to
      7,000
      megawatts previously claimed.
      While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the
      report notes
      that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of
      reasons,
      including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power
      purchased by July
      1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds,
      but none
      have yet been issued.
      ""We are exposed enormously this summer,"" Senate Energy Committee
      chairwoman
      Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report. ""We
      owe the
      people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be. We
      don't have a
      power fairy.""
      Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall
      significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5%
      of the
      state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can
      be many
      times those of long-term contracts.
      After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University
      economist who
      studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested
      that the
      state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the
      state will
      need this summer.
      ""We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of
      2003,"" he
      said.
      California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a
      cost of $50
      million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern
      California Edison
      and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed billions of
      dollars in
      debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market.
      Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals
      with
      generators, said the report represents a ""work in progress."" He said
      the state
      may yet sign new contracts.
      However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others
      have been
      dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts
      unless serious
      steps to cut demand are taken immediately.
      Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be
      switched to
      real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of
      their energy at
      times of low demand.
      The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit
      that promotes
      sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on
      Wednesday.
      ""The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this
      summer,""
      foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter.
      He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient
      appliances and
      lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities'
      contracts with
      alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and
      sign new
      contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest,
      fastest and
      cleanest source of new supply.
      Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to
      pay the
      alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since
      November. But some
      of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little
      incentive to turn
      on their generators.
      Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the
      electricity
      consumed in California.
      Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal
      sources. But
      most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of
      natural gas has
      been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan, which caps
      rates,
      won't cover their fuel costs.
      Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small
      generators say
      they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to
      gamble on
      future prices.
      The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis'
      proposal next
      week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if
      they agree
      to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10
      years.
      ""The price of natural gas is higher than that,"" said Marty Quinn,
      executive vice
      president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC, which
      owns three
      natural gas-fired co-generation plants. ""If we operate, we'll lose
      money.""
      Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The
      company
      sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its
      contracts
      with the utility.
      A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by
      a small
      energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued
      Edison for
      refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market.
      CalEnergy
      says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since
      November.
      A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead
      with its suit
      despite Davis' proposal. ""We've had promises before,"" he said.
      In other developments:
      * A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy
      of Houston,
      a major producer, to continue selling power to California during
      emergencies,
      despite the company's argument that it may not be fully reimbursed.
      The order
      will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S. Federal Energy
      Regulatory
      Commission decides a related case.
      * Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion
      because the
      state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She criticized
      the
      administration for withholding basic information about state
      finances, and said
      she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of Water
      Resources, which is
      responsible for purchasing power.
      Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic
      governor
      endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles
      mayor,
      former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. A Connell aide scoffed
      at the
      notion.
      * Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she ""never has had a
      response"" from
      President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to
      discuss the
      California energy crisis.
      In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she
      deplored the fact
      that ""huge, huge profits are being made"" in the California crisis,
      and said ""an
      appropriate federal role"" would be to guarantee a reliable source of
      power until
      the state can get nine new generators online.

      according to a Cal-ISO report.
      * The state may have to buy most of its power for summer on the
      costly spot

      CPUC Must Address Rates In QF Repayment Order - SoCal Ed
      03/21/2001
      Dow Jones Energy Service
      (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

      LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Any order from the California Public
      Utilities
      Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators
      going
      forward must determine how that could be done within the existing
      rate
      structure, a spokesman for Edison International (EIX) utility
      Southern
      California Edison said Wednesday.
      The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would
      require
      utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, $79
      a megawatt
      hour within 15 days of electricity delivery. The decision will be
      voted March 27
      by the CPUC.

      ""We're still reviewing (the decision) and should have more to say in
      a day or
      two. To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward
      of course
      we will. But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs,"" a SoCal
      Edison
      spokesman said.
      SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are
      struggling
      under nearly $13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an
      inability to pass
      high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze.
      Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid
      their QF bills
      in full since December. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some
      partial
      payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing. Together, they
      owe the QFs
      about $1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt.
      An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp
      comments, that the
      company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors.
      ""The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the
      current rate base
      to pay our bills,"" said Edison Senior Vice President of Public
      Affairs Bob
      Foster. ""We understand the financial distress (the QFs) face; we are
      facing
      financial distress ourselves.""
      The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned
      utilities
      to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power
      for $79/MWh
      and $69/MWh, respectively.
      The QFs ""may be able to live with"" the PUC proposal, but the five-
      and 10-year
      contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the
      California
      borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent
      Energy
      Producers Association. Natural gas prices into California are
      currently higher
      than anywhere in the country.
      But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the
      QFs from
      filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for
      the money
      they are still owed.
      ""There's still a lot of skepticism. To say our position has changed
      based on the
      CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate. A lot
      still has to
      happen,"" said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors
      committee.

      State Says It's Accelerating Plan to Buy Power Utilities' Grid
      Government: Talks with Edison are reported near completion, but
      agreement with heavily indebted PG&E has a way to go.

      SACRAMENTO -- As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday, a
      key
      consultant to Gov. Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid
      owned by
      the state's largest utilities ""are proceeding at an accelerated
      pace.""
      Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern
      California Edison
      could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E are much
      less
      advanced.

      The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in
      principle, he
      said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its transmission
      lines are
      more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart.
      The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other
      assets for
      about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabilize the
      electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued
      California for
      months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has
      had to pore
      over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities.
      ""We are working at a good pace,"" said Fichera, chief executive of the
      New York
      firm Saber Partners. "" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might be
      longer.""
      By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public
      Utilities
      Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis administration
      was clearly
      trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the
      governor's plan
      to pull the state out of the crisis.
      Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and
      suppliers stopped
      selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying
      electricity from a
      handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and North
      Carolina. Not a
      cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in
      California who
      provide about a quarter of the state's electricity.
      The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the
      cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and
      wind power
      units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison
      and PG&E
      have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of
      cash.
      Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the
      alternative
      suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with
      ""almost 700
      individual contractors.""
      Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin
      (R-La
      Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative
      plan to
      lower the small producers' prices, was ""the huge enmity . . .
      manifested between
      the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These people just don't
      like each
      other.""
      This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis
      administration:

      * When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt
      counts.
      During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County can
      make the
      difference between full power and blackouts.
      * There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole
      energy equation
      is balanced, the parts don't work.
      For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come
      together or
      utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the
      19%
      already set in motion * The cost of power purchased by the state must
      be reduced
      through long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers.
      These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has
      kept
      confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram
      Budhraja of
      the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it
      has concluded
      40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signed.
      According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of
      Water
      Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still
      well above
      the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a
      planned
      $10-billion bond offering to succeed.
      The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state
      for the
      money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state
      is currently
      spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices stay
      high, the
      $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power purchases by
      the end of
      the summer.
      Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds
      until the
      Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a
      portion of
      utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has
      estimated that,
      under the January law that put the state in the power buying
      business, the state
      must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3 billion is
      needed to
      service the debt.
      PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to
      announce his
      ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC
      vote on the
      matter as early as next week.
      * The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers,
      known as
      qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an
      average of
      more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday,
      Davis said
      he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year
      contracts and 7.5
      cents for five-year contracts.
      Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said
      Tuesday that the
      commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern
      California
      Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in
      the future.
      Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have
      enough cash on
      hand for that.
      ""We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,""
      Lynch said.
      ""The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't been
      paid and that
      it is impairing their ability to provide power.""
      The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they
      owe them,
      there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors.
      ""There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the
      [alternative
      producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay the
      utilities for
      their generation,"" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E.
      * The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce
      themselves, mainly
      from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly above the
      cost of
      producing it. This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the
      Davis
      administration and the utilities to restore the near-bankrupt
      utilities to
      solvency.

      Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog: As part of secret deal to
      get long-term energy contracts, state would pay for some of the
      credits that allow excess power plant emissions. Critics renew call
      for full disclosure.

      SACRAMENTO -- As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy
      electricity, Gov.
      Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay
      potentially
      millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air,
      Davis said
      Tuesday.
      Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals
      with 20
      generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10
      years.

      However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the
      contracts or
      detail various terms, contending that release of such information
      would hamper
      the state's ability to negotiate deals with other generators and
      therefore
      ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity.
      Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of
      anonymity, said
      the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company based in
      Houston, is one
      that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of
      credits that
      allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss
      the
      company's deal with the state.
      ""We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,""
      Davis said of
      the decision to pay the fees of some generators. ""We had to lock down
      some power
      so we were not totally dependent on the spot market.""
      The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as
      RECLAIM.
      Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of
      allowable
      pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are required
      to purchase
      credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45 per
      pound of
      pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10 million
      a year for
      a power plant.
      The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates
      pollution in
      the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly lower
      the cost of
      the system--a step that could considerably cut the state's potential
      cost, Davis
      said.
      Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)
      defended the
      decision to cover the power company's costs.
      ""It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,"" she
      said. ""If
      it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it.""
      Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay
      pollution fees
      caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davis to
      reconsider the
      secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment provision
      underscores
      the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the
      state will
      pay for its megawatts, the critics note.
      ""The Legislature should have known about it,"" said Senate President
      Pro Tem John
      Burton (D-San Francisco). ""It is going to cost taxpayers money. It
      makes you
      wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed with
      the
      Legislature.""
      V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents
      alternative
      energy producers, called the contract proposal ""a horrible
      precedent.""
      ""Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a
      subsidy
      this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of
      principle this
      is,"" White said.
      Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke,
      general
      counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the
      provision in
      question ""raises the possibility that there are other [concessions]""
      that have
      not yet come to light.
      In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators
      probably will
      exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management
      districts.
      To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep
      plants
      running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the
      contracts
      said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the
      state would
      cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover
      the cost
      of fines.
      A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      underscores
      the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, which is
      partners
      with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long Beach
      and
      Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its ""aggregate expenditures for
      compliance
      with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into
      the
      environment"" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in
      1999.
      A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's
      facilities appear
      to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy
      has been
      seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is
      dirtier than
      natural gas.
      Davis said he intends to ""make this information public,"" but he added
      that ""we
      do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking them
      to pay
      higher prices.""
      ""Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully
      forthcoming,"" Davis said. ""But I also have a corollary responsibility
      that I
      don't stick these generators with a higher rate.""


      FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE
      CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR
      03/21/2001
      Foster Electric Report
      5
      (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.

      Following a preliminary, non-public investigation, FERC directed AES
      Southland
      Inc. and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. (IN01-3) on March 14
      to show
      cause why they did not violate section 205 of the Federal Power Act
      (FPA) by
      failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability
      must-run
      (RMR) generator units during a period in April and May 2000. The
      investigation
      responded to a matter referred by the Cal-ISO. If a violation is
      found, Williams
      Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of $10.9
      million (as
      calculated by FERC) and face restrictions on their market-based rate
      authority
      for a year.
      The show cause order involves two generation units (Alamitos 4 and
      Huntington
      Beach 2), owned and operated by AES. Williams Energy markets all
      output from the
      Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants, including the two units at
      issue here,
      pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission. The
      Cal-ISO
      designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when
      necessary to
      provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of
      the
      California transmission network. The Cal-ISO makes both a fixed
      payment to the
      RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability
      and a
      variable payment for the RMR unit's output (if the unit is not
      otherwise
      participating in the market). Williams Energy and the Cal-ISO
      executed RMR
      agreements, filed as rate schedules with the Commission, allowing the
      Cal-ISO to
      dispatch units ""solely for purposes of meeting local reliability
      needs or
      managing intra-zonal congestion."" The ISO may dispatch a non-RMR unit
      if the
      designated RMR unit is not available. Under its RMR agreement with
      the ISO,
      Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost
      for
      operating RMR units. However, if a non-RMR unit has to be dispatched
      because a
      designated RMR unit is unavailable, Williams will be paid its bid
      price, not the
      RMR contract price.

      During the April to May 2000 period, the Cal-ISO sought to dispatch
      both
      Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 as RMR units to provide voltage
      support.
      However, according to the FERC order, Williams Energy refused to make
      Alamitos 4
      available from April 25 through May 5, and to make Huntington Beach 2
      available
      from May 6 through May 11, ""for reasons not directly related to the
      necessary
      and timely maintenance of the units."" Consequently, the Cal-ISO was
      forced to
      dispatch non-RMR units at a higher cost, namely, Williams Energy's
      bid price for
      service provided by the replacement units.
      By contrast, if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been
      available
      from April 25 through May 11, Williams Energy would have received
      either (1) the
      market revenues only from the respective units, which would have
      resulted in no
      payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy, or (2)
      Williams
      Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market
      revenues from
      the respective units' output. Accordingly, FERC observed, Williams
      Energy had ""a
      financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos 4 and
      Huntington Beach 2
      in April and May 2000.""
      The bid price for the non-RMR units was at or near the Cal-ISO's
      then-effective
      bid cap of $750/MWh, FERC continued. Therefore, Williams Energy
      received
      payments from the Cal-ISO of more than $11.3 million, or about $10.3
      million
      greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the
      non-RMR units
      (approximately $63/MWh) during the period in question. This indicates
      a refund
      amount, including interest, of nearly $10.9 million.
      The information in this order and a non-public appendix, the
      Commission
      declared, suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and
      maintained
      Huntington Beach 2 in a manner inconsistent with good utility
      practice, and that
      Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos 4 and to
      make
      Huntington Beach 2 unavailable for ""pretextual reasons.""
      Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial
      incentive not
      to make the Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 units available, FERC
      found
      serious questions about whether (1) AES and Williams Energy violated
      applicable
      RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA
      section
      205 when they refused to make Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2
      available for
      dispatch by the Cal-ISO; (2) whether Williams acted inconsistently
      with its
      market-based rate authority and the market monitoring information
      protocols of
      the Cal-ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units
      during the
      period at issue; and (3) whether AES violated a tolling agreement on
      file with
      the Commission pursuant to section 205.
      The Commission identified two remedies for these potential
      violations: a refund
      by Williams Energy and/or AES of revenues received greater than the
      amount that
      would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been
      available, and a
      condition on Williams Energy's market-based rate authority.
      Specifically, for a
      one-year period, if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by
      the
      Cal-ISO, a non-RMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive
      payment
      according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract. In other
      words, Williams
      Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the
      substitute, non- RMR
      unit.
      The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause, within
      20 days,
      why they should not be found to have committed the above-described
      violations
      and why the specified remedies should not be imposed.
      Further, to ensure procurement of all relevant information, the
      Commission
      instituted a formal, non-public investigation into the operation,
      maintenance
      and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in
      2000 and
      2001.


      Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts
      03/20/2001
      Dow Jones Energy Service
      (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

      LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California consumers haven't been
      conserving enough
      electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in
      the state,
      a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday.
      The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling
      blackouts,
      consumers aren't using less electricity, which means additional
      megawatts will
      be taken off the grid. As a result, blackouts could last longer and
      impact
      additional communities, the ISO said.

      ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday ""conservation in California is
      no longer
      an option,"" but consumers in the state aren't heeding the call to
      reduce
      consumption.
      Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were
      far less
      than Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, when blackouts swept through Northern
      California due
      to transmission constraints. Jim Detmers, the ISO's vice president of
      operation,
      said consumers saved the state about 1,000 megawatts of electricity,
      enough
      power for 1 million houses.
      The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about 500 MW or less.
      ""We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time,"" Detmers
      said.
      The state's Energy Commission said consumers think it's no longer
      important to
      save electricity until blackouts are imposed.
      ""People have been saving generally, but it isn't a big bump from hour
      to hour,""
      a spokesman for the Energy Commission said.
      Gov. Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month,
      promising
      consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at
      least 20% of
      electricity, compared with last summer.
      The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to
      possibly
      saving 5,000 MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts.

      Gas Co.'s Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier
      has reaped
      millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs.
      Though
      consumers get a share of the windfall, regulators are asking whether
      they should
      get more of the bonus, which is expected to be huge this year, as a
      form of
      price relief. The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its
      reward.

      SAN FRANCISCO -- While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the
      big
      electric utilities lurch toward insolvency, the news is not all dire
      at Southern
      California Gas Co.
      Through vigorous deal making, the Sempra Energy subsidiary has
      consistently
      beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year, and the
      company
      stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state
      incentive program
      that rewards utilities for keeping costs down.

      For several years, the utility has been splitting the savings 50-50
      with
      ratepayers whenever the company's gas costs fall slightly below
      market levels.
      Those savings, Gas Co. executives acknowledged, have shot to
      unprecedented
      heights during the state's power crisis.
      Now, in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market
      prices,
      regulators are taking another look at the program. The question
      before the
      Public Utilities Commission: Should Gas Co. ratepayers, who endured
      huge bill
      increases this winter, get a bigger share of the savings?
      The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years
      exceeded $20
      million. But the amount for the last 12 months is expected to
      multiply many
      times over, company executives said, partly because the Gas Co. has
      done so well
      in the wild market by selling, lending and trading gas as well as
      buying it.
      ""The recent market conditions . . . could possibly result in some
      unintended
      consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be
      more
      appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers,"" the PUC's consumer
      protection
      arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, reported Oct. 30, even before
      the latest
      upward market spirals.
      Gas Co. representatives express frustration, saying they have done
      what the
      state has requested under its gas-cost incentive program: Buy
      smarter, and pass
      the savings along to its 5 million residential and small-business
      customers. The
      company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be
      rewarded
      for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost.
      ""The PUC, every time we do well, raises the bar on us,"" said Jim
      Harrigan,
      director of gas acquisition. ""I don't necessarily agree with it.""
      By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity,
      the Gas Co.
      has become a big player in the regional natural gas market. In the
      company's
      bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters, 15 employees
      track price
      movements, pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer, while
      cutting
      deals and arranging gas shipments.
      Although the Gas Co. buys the commodity for its customers, the
      company also
      sells to marketers, other utilities and producers. State officials
      say the
      number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to 10,000 to
      20,000 a
      year, including gas sales along California's border, where prices
      have rocketed.

      The PUC created the cost incentive program for the state's three
      major gas
      utilities--San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in 1993, Southern California
      Gas the
      next year and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1997. Like
      Southern
      California Gas, SDG&E is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy.
      The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for
      obtaining gas at
      the best price for customers. It replaced lengthy and contentious
      reviews by the
      PUC, which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable
      prices and
      sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers.
      An annual audit of the Gas Co. program and a staff evaluation
      requested by the
      PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its
      goals, but it
      also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share
      of the
      rewards.
      ""These incentives were designed in less volatile times,"" said program
      supervisor
      Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which conducted the
      audit.
      ""There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and
      shareholders."" His
      office also plans to assess whether the Gas Co.'s trading had any
      negative
      effects on the gas market, resulting in diminished supplies or higher
      prices for
      other utilities and their customers.
      Under the program, the Gas Co. shares risks and rewards with its
      ratepayers, but
      since the program was launched, it has consistently produced awards.
      If the cost
      of gas is 0.5% or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market
      indexes,
      the company and its customers split the savings 50-50.
      California's gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw
      commodity
      costs; they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no
      markup. The
      savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in
      consumers'
      monthly gas bills but are not itemized.
      At the end of the year, the utilities request their share of the
      savings, and
      the PUC has routinely granted approval. Then the companies, and thus
      their
      shareholders, are paid through customer utility bills.
      The resulting bill increases typically have been modest, less than
      1%. But as
      the awards increase, regulators say, the effect on customers will
      become more
      significant unless the present structure is changed.
      ""There's no question, when you start to talk about $100 million [or
      more in
      savings], and add [the company's award] into rates in a year, it will
      make a
      noticeable difference,"" said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger,
      president of
      Econ One, who has done consulting for the Gas Co.
      Still, he said, ratepayers should bear in mind that they already
      benefit from
      below-market gas and transportation costs.
      In the early years of the program, records show, the Gas Co.'s awards
      went from
      zero to $3.2 million, $10.6 million, $2 million and $7.7 million.
      Last year's
      award of $9.8 million is awaiting PUC approval.
      This year's proposed award, covering the period through the end of
      this month,
      has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co. But the utility has
      provided monthly
      figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials,
      who declined
      to provide figures.
      Harrigan of the Gas Co. said the savings are expected to multiply
      ""many times
      over,"" largely because the company was well-equipped for the market
      fluctuations
      and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices.
      ""Any trading company, especially one with assets like we have, has
      benefited
      from volatility in the market,"" he said.
      Harrigan said, however, that he does not believe the company's level
      of activity
      has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in
      volume to that
      of unregulated energy companies.
      Anne Smith, the Gas Co.'s vice president of customer service and
      marketing, said
      the utility will not release figures for this year's incentive
      program until
      they are filed with the PUC in June.
      ""I don't want to interrupt that process,"" Smith said, noting that the
      PUC
      ultimately will determine the company's award. ""I think they need to
      focus on
      what [the Gas Co.] has done for the ratepayers. It has been immense.""
      Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to $80 from $50 a
      year ago, Gas
      Co. customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California
      utilities.

      The company's gas procurement cost in February was 66 cents per
      therm, or 100
      cubic feet. That's more than twice last year's cost but only about
      half what
      sister company SDG&E paid for its 740,000 customers in February. It's
      also much
      lower than the $1.09 per therm PG&E pays.
      ""We were as upset about the overall [gas price] increase as anyone
      else,""
      Harrigan said. ""I would rather see the prices of a year ago, even
      though we
      managed to do a little better in the [recent] environment.""
      When it comes to keeping down costs, regulators say, the Gas Co. has
      advantages
      over other utilities in the marketplace. For one, the company has so
      much
      pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively
      small
      portion of its needs--about 10% to 15%--at the California border,
      where prices
      in December briefly rose to the equivalent of $6 per therm, or 20
      times those a
      year earlier.
      This presents opportunities.
      ""At the beginning of the month, they forecast a certain amount of gas
      they have
      to buy,"" said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ""If they go
      out and
      buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more
      moderate than
      expected, they can either inject the gas into storage or they can
      make sales at
      the border.""
      With gas price run-ups like those seen in the last year, Pocta said,
      ""there is a
      question: Should that benefit be shared, or flow entirely to
      ratepayers?""
      Customers, he pointed out, may be entitled to additional benefits
      because they
      pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas
      storage that
      give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals.
      ""By the same token, we want [the Gas Co.] . . . to go into the market
      and
      generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers,"" he
      added. ""We
      want them to have incentives. The question is how to balance them.""
      Under deregulation, the Gas Co. adopted the nontraditional role of
      marketer,
      according to a PUC Energy Division report in January. The company
      makes gas
      sales at various locations. It engages in exchanges. It makes futures
      transactions to help stabilize costs.
      ""They look for ways to lower the gas cost,"" said Richard Myers,
      program
      supervisor at the Energy Division. ""Before they were lots more
      risk-averse. Now
      they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders, and it
      is a
      benefit for ratepayers at the same time.""
      The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities, so it is
      difficult
      to compare them. Records show that the shared savings at SDG&E, a
      much smaller
      utility, declined steadily from $9.2 million in the 1996-97 cycle to
      $560,000 in
      1999-2000.
      Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in
      gas
      purchases, especially as the company sold off its own gas-fired
      electricity-generating plants. He said the company does not yet know
      how much
      savings have accrued in the last year.
      In an annual report to the PUC in February, PG&E said it had no
      savings under
      the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for
      the 1999-2000
      cycle.
      The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy
      group, said
      it will closely watch the PUC's evaluation of the incentive program
      at the Gas
      Co.
      ""We want to make sure, given the dramatic changes in the gas market
      and prices,
      ratepayers are not left out of the [additional] benefits,"" TURN
      attorney Marcel
      Hawiger said. ""We'll look to see whether the mechanism should be
      changed.""
      Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley,
      said the
      program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to
      enter
      long-term contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market.
      ""Unfortunately, under the system,"" he said, ""the only incentive is to
      beat the
      [spot] market.""

      New York:   New York at the crossroads
      Wednesday, March 21, 2001


      Energy Insight



      (Embedded image moved to file: pic24389.pcx)



      By Dave Todd



      dtodd@ftenergy.com



      U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big
      Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising
      energy prices.


      Delivering the keynote address at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's
      national energy summit in Washington Monday, Abraham said,
      ""California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply
      and demand,"" what with ""electricity shortages predicted for New York
      City and Long Island this summer"" and low capacity margins
      threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country. But
      how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort
      confronting Californians?


      Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing
      director of Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors. Krapels, a
      consultant helping major Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated
      Edison, design market-hedging programs, adamantly decried what he
      said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and
      California, there being ""more differences than there are
      similarities"" between those two industrial cornerstones of the
      country's economy in respect to energy security management.


      ""First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy
      generation sources than California,"" he said. California has hydro,
      nuclear and gas, but when it lost a lot of hydro, the state needed
      gas to pick up the slack, and the ""capacity just wasn't there."" In
      New York's case, the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its
      overall dependence on gas is much lower than California's, Krapels
      added.


      New York avoids making same mistakes


      Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New
      York avoid the same errors made in redesigning California's
      marketplace. New York's Independent System Operator (ISO), in a new
      report warning that the state is at an ""energy crossroads"" in terms
      of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future, argues that a
      concerted effort is required to arrest declining in-state generation
      capacity reserve margins, and a strategy must be put in place,
      whether or not new generation comes on-line, in accordance with
      current anticipated scenarios.


      A measure of New York's essential difficulty is that, between 1995
      and 2000, statewide demand for electricity grew 2,700 MW, while
      generating capacity expanded by only 1,060 MW. With no major new
      generating plants in downstate New York fully approved, the gap is
      expected to continue to widen. To avoid ""a replication of
      California's market meltdown"" the New York ISO calculates the state's
      daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, with
      more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island.
      Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current
      bureaucratic process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed
      ombudsman named to help would-be merchant power plant investors plow
      through red tape.


      ""Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the
      state's escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of
      electricity,"" the ISO added. ""Since 1999, New York State has been
      unable to cover its reserve requirements from in-state sources.""


      Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for
      circling the wagons inward. Some analysts believe the ultimate
      solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power, but in
      expanding the marketplace by breaking down inter-jurisdictional
      barriers. In any case, New York energy regulatory authorities and
      those responsible elsewhere in the U.S. Northeast, such as PJM
      (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) Interconnection and the New
      England Power Pool, are in vastly better shape in terms of
      ""cross-border"" cooperation than California and its neighbors in that
      efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an
      integrated regional electricity market. In California, by contrast,
      the state's focus?for example, in the case of new gas-fired power
      plant development?has been to ensure dedicated supply to the
      California market alone, rather than on a regional marketplace.




      (Embedded image moved to file: pic05075.pcx)

      The New York ISO's new broad-based analysis of market-restructuring
      needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed
      environment is ""due in large part to the ability of New York's
      utilities to enter into long-term power contracts.""


      What needs to be done most, it says, is to move aggressively to build
      some of the more than 29,000 MW of ""proposed new generation in the
      siting pipeline.""


      In the meantime, the 30,200 MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a
      peak day last summer shouldn't be eclipsed on too many days this
      coming summer (given early long-range weather forecasts). Demand,
      however, is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to
      1.4%.


      So while New York City, the rest of the state and adjacent parts
      might breathe easy this year, it could be a brief rest from the fray.
      Meanwhile, a 4% shortfall is still being planned for this summer that
      is not yet provided for, as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new
      generation plants around Manhattan, on Long Island and even on barges
      offshore.


      One way or another, whether it is the weather or the politics of
      siting new energy facilities, it's going to be a hot time in the
      city.


      Long-term solutions hit brick wall


      Meanwhile, attempts at longer-term solutions continue to run into
      trouble. Last week, Connecticut state regulators came out against a
      proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that
      Hydro-Quebec subsidiary TransEnergie U.S. Ltd. wants to build to pump
      more juice into Long Island Power Authority's load pocket. Despite
      strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage
      to oyster beds in Long Island Sound, the proposal failed to convince
      authorities, who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to
      diversion of electricity from Connecticut.


      In similar fashion, private companies wanting to build 10 small
      independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York
      City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups
      and citizen orga
nizations?some of whom have taken their cases to the
      state assembly in Albany.


      The David vs. Goliath nature of such controversies has further
      alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex
      energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not
      wanting things in their backyard, regardless of what the alternative
      might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good.


      But suddenly, in New York, California's troubles?while still distant
      in their intensity? may not be so far away. By some estimates, this
      summer's bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much
      as one third or more over last year's charges.


      Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure
      isn't going to make the pain go away.



      NEW YORK:  NY-ISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS 4,000 - 5,000 MW OF NEW
      GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES; NY-ISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO
      EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
      03/21/2001
      Foster Electric Report

      Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California
      crisis, the New
      York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NY-ISO) is warning of serious
      electricity shortages, air quality deterioration and stunted economic
      growth
      without immediate approval of between 4,000-5,000 MW of new
      generating capacity
      in the state. Of this amount, 2,000-3,000 MW is needed to serve New
      York City.
      Another 8,600 MW of new capacity will have to be built by 2005, the
      NY-ISO said
      in a recent report, Power Alert: New York's Energy Crossroads.
      ""New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts
      immediately
      to get new supply sited within its borders,"" said NY-ISO president
      William
      Museler in a statement accompanying the report. ""This report is
      essentially a
      caution light at New York's energy crossroads.""

      Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the
      NY-ISO's
      warning, asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is
      well
      underway, with more than 85 projects in the approval pipeline.
      In a related development, the NY-ISO asked FERC to approve a proposed
      tariff
      amendment (ER01-1517) extending existing bids caps in some of its
      markets until
      10/31/02, and a separate and related amendment (ER01-1489) extending
      the
      NY-ISO's so-called temporary extraordinary procedures (TEP) that
      allow the ISO
      to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it
      finds evidence
      of market power abuse.
      The NY-ISO Report --The NY-ISO likened the situation in New York to
      that faced
      by California, where a relentless increase in demand has not been met
      with an
      equal increase in supply. The NY-ISO said that between 1995 and 2000,
      statewide
      demand for electricity rose by 2,700 MW, while generating capacity
      increased by
      only 1,060 MW. With no major new generating plants in downstate New
      York fully
      approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the
      state
      expected to grow around 1.3 percent annually for the next several
      years, the
      NY-ISO said this gap will continue to widen.
      The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New
      York's power
      consumers. The NY-ISO's modeling suggests that ""by 2005, statewide
      prices are
      likely to be more than 20-25 percent lower in the case in which new
      plants are
      built than in the case where they are not."" In New York City, ""the
      price to
      consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as 28 percent
      when
      compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs.""
      Besides large rate increases, the NY-ISO asserted that a failure to
      site and
      build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the
      state and
      lead to increasing reliance on out-of-state resources. The report
      said that if
      no new in-state generation comes on line in the next five years, the
      state's
      generation reserve margins will shrink from the current 14.9 percent
      above peak
      demand ""to a dangerously low 8.4 percent by 2005."" Pointing to
      California's
      situation, the report added that increased reliance on power imports
      ""can
      subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to
      transmission
      restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the
      control or
      influence of responsible New York State entities.""
      To avoid these harsh consequences, the NY-ISO said New York's new
      siting law,
      known as the Article X process, needs to be modified. Since the law
      was passed
      18 months ago, the report noted that only two plants have been
      approved (both
      upstate) and neither has yet been built. The problem, according to
      the NY-ISO,
      is that the siting process ""requires the cooperation of multiple
      state
      agencies."" To expedite the process, the report suggested the ""clear
      designation
      of a lead agency and the adoption of an `ombudsman program' to
      expedite and
      coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X
      process must
      be made."" The NY-ISO added that an expedited approval process would
      improve the
      environment because older, more polluting power plants would be
      replaced by
      cleaner gas-fired units.
      On a more positive note, the NY-ISO reported that New York's
      restructured power
      market ""is far healthier than that in California, due in large part
      to the
      ability of New York `s utilities to enter long-term power contracts.
      The basic
      structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price
      spikes and
      other market disruptions through mitigation programs which
      automatically correct
      price spikes due to market power abuses.""
      ""Nevertheless, California `s experience raises a caution flag for all
      New
      Yorkers,"" the report continued. ""The deregulated market in New York
      cannot
      achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in
      generating
      capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report,
      along with
      simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation, better load
      management
      and alternative energy supply initiatives. Additionally, closer
      integration with
      regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial.""
      The report also recommended (1) accelerating conservation, real-time
      metering
      and price-sensitive load programs; and (2) upgrading the state's and
      the
      Northeast's transmission infrastructure.
      The Proposed Tariff Amendments -- New York's Article X siting process
      and
      continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NY-ISO's request to
      extend from
      4/30/01 until 10/31/02 its $1,000/MWh bid caps. FERC first approved
      the
      1,000/MWh bid caps in July 2000 (see REPORT No.197, pg.6), and
      subsequently
      extended them.
      The NY-ISO's board ""is sensitive to the Commission's concerns about
      undue
      intervention in energy markets,"" the filing related. ""Nevertheless,
      the NY-ISO
      is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New
      York state's
      `Article X' process for licensing and siting new generating capacity
      is
      inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth. .
      . .
      Moreover, although the NY-ISO proposes to implement several
      demand-side measures
      this summer, it is not yet clear whether they will make demand
      sufficiently
      price-responsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur
      if there
      were an efficient demand-side response.""
      Thus, the NY-ISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to
      provide more
      time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the
      effectiveness
      of the NY-ISO's proposed demand-side response mechanisms ""in order to
      avoid
      exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the
      interplay of
      competitive market forces.""
      Other problems cited in the NY-ISO's filing which keep New York's
      power market
      from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and
      operating
      constraints at the state's Central-East interface, and questions over
      adequate
      gas supply.
      ""The NY-ISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with
      price
      abnormalities can have undesirable consequences,"" the filing
      continued.
      ""Nevertheless, the NY-ISO believes that the $1,000/MWh cap that has
      been used in
      the PJM's markets since inception does not appear to have had an
      adverse impact
      there. . . . The permanent bid caps in PJM, and the interim bid caps
      in ISO New
      England (proposed for extension through the end of 2001) also make
      continuation
      of the NY-ISO's bid caps more important in order to maintain
      uniformity across
      the Northeastern markets. The NY-ISO also continues to believe that
      suppliers
      will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps, which
      are likely
      to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent
      only
      artificially high run-ups in prices.""
      The NY-ISO's request to extend its TEP procedures (which also were
      previously
      extended) through 10/31/02 cited similar problems with New York's
      power markets,
      but claimed that the NY-ISO ""has made great strides"" toward
      eliminating market
      design and software flaws. ""The TEPs were, and remain, an
      indispensable tool for
      responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where
      the markets
      are not operating as the NY-ISO and the Commission intended,"" the
      filing
      insisted.


      MASSACHUSETTS:  Attorney general says summer poses electricity
      concerns
      By JOHN McELHENNY
      Associated Press Writer
      03/19/2001
      Associated Press Newswires

      BOSTON (AP) - The state's top consumer advocate warned that
      Massachusetts may
      see ""California-type"" electricity blackouts this summer when
      temperatures rise
      and residents turn on air conditioners and fans.
      ""It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem,"" said
      Attorney
      General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press. ""Our
      major
      problem will come this summer.""

      State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the
      factors blamed
      for local power outages in California, and on Monday, California for
      the first
      time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state.
      Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in
      1998 to
      attract more companies to stir competition. But that hasn't happened
      yet,
      largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it
      expensive to
      produce electricity.
      ""The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be
      competition,"" said
      Reilly, a Democrat. ""That competition in the wholesale market is not
      happening.""

      Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air
      conditioners and fans, and Reilly said a few particularly hot days
      could strain
      the grid that provides the region's power.
      A spokeswoman for the region's power grid said electricity use is
      expected to
      rise 1.5 to 2 percent this year, but the region should have enough
      power because
      of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the
      past 18
      months.
      ""The situation is unlike California because we have new generation
      coming on
      line that is outpacing demand,"" said Ellen Foley, spokeswoman for ISO
      New
      England Inc., which manages the grid of 330 generators connected by
      8,000 miles
      of high voltage transmission lines.
      Still, a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation
      breakdown could
      prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity, a situation that
      arose once
      last summer, Foley said.
      In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers, Reilly
      repeated calls
      for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more
      options for
      new customers who have signed up since deregulation. Those customers
      typically
      pay more than long-term customers.
      Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into
      two-year
      contracts with suppliers, instead of the six-month contracts many
      have now, to
      avoid short-term price spikes for consumers, Reilly said.
      The Attorney General's Office acts as an advocate for consumers.
      Michael Monahan, a spokesman for NSTAR, which provides electricity to
      more than
      1 million customers, is upgrading some of its power lines and last
      year built a
      new line to Cape Cod, but currently has no lines under construction.
      ""I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that it's
      something we have
      to focus on,"" Monahan said, but he added, ""The indications I see are
      that we
      have an ample supply of electricity.""
      California's statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a
      transformer fire,
      high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves
      to near
      zero.
      California partially deregulated its electric industry in 1996, two
      years before
      Massachusetts.

      NEVADA:  Discussion of bill stopping power plant sales to continue
      Wednesday
      By JOHN WILKERSON
      Associated Press Writer
      03/19/2001
      Associated Press Newswires

      CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying
      to pass a
      measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to
      avoid
      California-style energy problems.
      ""The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power
      plants and
      making sure it's constitutional,"" said Senate Commerce and Labor
      Chairman
      Randolph Townsend, R-Reno. ""And that's not as easy as it sounds.""

      Townsend's comment just before his committee began working on SB253
      was
      prophetic - witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility
      in the
      measure.
      Translation: Don't kill all deals by stopping Reno-based Sierra
      Pacific Power
      and Las Vegas-based Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power
      plants until
      June 2003 - and possibly until 2006.
      Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to
      buy a power
      plant, said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before
      2003 a deal
      that would be in the public's interest.
      ""If you put a two-year moratorium on these plants, all these deals
      are going to
      go away,"" he said. ""When the cow leaves the barn, it's difficult to
      catch.""
      Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB253 on Monday. Now
      it's up for
      review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee.
      Reliant isn't the only company trying to keep power plant purchases
      alive.
      Earlier this month, executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the
      committee that
      it's in the public's interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to
      sell its
      Harry Allen power plant.
      The Harry Allen plant produces about 72 megawatts out of the 2,900
      megawatts of
      energy that Nevada utilities generate. Pinnacle has plans to expand
      that to 700
      megawatts by 2004.
      Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures, such
      as ways in
      which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing
      the sales
      contracts, don't have to be included in SB253, Townsend said.
      Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and
      utility
      deregulation can be handled in later bills - but the power plant sale
      issue must
      be handled now.
      Nevada's PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had
      directed Sierra
      Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the
      companies'
      merger in 1999 under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources.
      Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the      
state's
      electricity - and if they're sold, the unregulated new owners could
      sell the
      power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma
      California faces of
      shrinking supply and rising prices.
      The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating
      that rate
      payers will save from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion by July 2001 if
      the power
      plant sales are stopped.
      Nevada's Consumer Advocate's Office previously had projected a
      conservative
      estimate of $915 million in savings.


      MAINE:  Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation
      By GLENN ADAMS

      AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - In the wake of rolling blackouts in California
      and rate
      spikes in their home state, Maine's top legislators proposed a study
      Monday into
      the effects of deregulation of the energy industry.
      ""Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to
      learn,""
      Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis.

      A panel of industry insiders, elected officials and consumers would
      study issues
      such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of
      energy
      shortfalls over the next three years, and whether Maine consumers are
      vulnerable
      to anti-competitive activities.
      In addition, the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether
      changes in
      Maine's deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating
      capacity,
      improve conservation and spur competition.
      The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power
      crisis in
      California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs, a consumer
      rate cap
      and too few power plants in that deregulated state.
      Maine's deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls, said
      Rep. William
      Savage, D-Buxton, House chairman of the Legislature's Utilities
      Committee.
      Maine's law does not cap consumer prices, as California's does, and
      the state
      has more than enough generating facilities to meet the state's energy
      needs,
      Savage said.
      Since Maine's deregulation law took effect in March 2000, Bangor
      Hydro-Electric
      Co. rates have increased 19 percent. The Public Utilities Commission
      approved a
      residential standard rate increase as recently as last month.
      Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep
      fee
      increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange
      enough
      capacity to meet customers' peak load. Gov. Angus King and all four
      members of
      Maine's congressional delegation oppose the hike.
      The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by
      Central
      Maine Power Co. to medium-sized and large industrial users.
      On the other hand, some towns and school districts are saving money
      on energy
      through deals they can get in the deregulated market.
      In the meantime, legislation has been introduced in response to some
      of the
      changes that have occurred in Maine's deregulated energy industry.
      One would use some of the money from the sale of power-generating
      assets to
      offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users, said Sen.
      Norman
      Ferguson, R-Hanover, Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee.
      Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they
      are not
      looking to make changes in Maine's deregulation law, but if it needs
      fixing it
      could be done during next year's session.
      The lawmakers' primary interest is to find out how trends in a new
      environment
      designed to encourage competition will affect consumers, and to try
      to identify
      what consumers can expect in the few years ahead.
      House Speaker Michael Saxl, D-Portland, said the Legislature ""has a
      fundamental
      public policy interest in making sure rate-payers and businesses are
      protected
      against exorbitant rate hikes.""

      OREGON:  State Senate moves to combat energy crisis
      03/16/2001

      SALEM, Ore. (AP) - In an attempt to avoid a California-like energy
      crisis, the
      Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process
      of siting
      power plants that use gas and renewable resources.
      ""It's important for Oregon. It makes sure that energy will be
      available to
      everyone,"" said Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield.

      The measure, SB843, would shorten the siting process for power plants
      that use
      gas and renewable resources, like wind, from a year and a half to a
      matter of
      months.
      The speeded-up process would be in effect for two years.
      ""If we can act now, we can actually start to solve power supply
      problems by this
      summer,"" said Sen. Jason Atkinson, R-Jacksonville
      California's strict regulations on the construction of new power
      plants has
      contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note. Beyer
      said though
      California was definitely a wake-up call, the measure is a reaction
      to the
      larger power picture in the Northwest.
      With low rainfall, hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting
      demand,
      Beyer said. Gas-fired and wind plants could come online as soon as
      this fall and
      would provide relief.
      ""We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy
      crisis the
      Northwest and the country are experiencing,"" said Senate Minority
      Leader Kate
      Brown, D-Portland.
      Conservationists, however, caution that lawmakers should be careful
      not to rush
      to provide power at the expense of environmental standards.



      WISCONSIN:  Two utilities to add 975 megawatts in plan to avoid
      energy crisis
      By The Associated Press
      03/22/2001

      Plans of two state utilities to add 975 megawatts to Wisconsin's
      electric power
      grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to California's
      were
      questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power
      plants may be
      in the works.
      ""Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California
      but there
      is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding,"" said Steve Hiniker,
      executive
      director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents consumer
      interests in
      utility rate cases. He noted that plant construction costs ultimately
      are born
      by the utility customers.

      Alliant Energy Corp. announced its proposal Wednesday - in a filing
      with the
      state Public Service Commission - to spend $1 billion to build one
      coal and two
      gas-fired power plants.
      Alliant has proposed building a 500 megawatt coal-fired plant and a
      100 megawatt
      natural-gas fired plant by 2006. It also wants to build a 200
      megawatt natural
      gas-fired facility in 2011. Wisconsin has not built a coal-fired
      plant in more
      than two decades.
      Alliant has not determined the plants' locations.
      Also, Madison Gas & Electric, the state's smallest investor-owned
      utility, said
      Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy 175 megawatts of power from
      three
      generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois.
      ""Three out of the four past summers, we've had public appeals for
      conservation
      due to shortages somewhere in the state. We need to take steps to
      avoid that,
      and the California situation makes that even more clear,"" said
      Alliant spokesman
      Chris Schoenherr. ""Getting more iron in the ground will give us more
      flexibility
      in the state to be able to react.""
      Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate
      increases, but it
      was too early to say how much rates would go up.
      California's problems, which this week resulted in the first
      deliberate
      blackouts since World War II, stemmed from underestimating the
      state's power
      needs, forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing
      them to
      secure long-term supply contracts, and freezing rates, among other
      things.
      But Wisconsin's situation is far different.
      The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation, and
      there has
      been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power
      reliability
      became a problem.
      The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional 3,000
      megawatts of
      power over the next decade.
      Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid
      overbuilding.
      The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers, meaning
      electric
      bills will increase as new generation is added. In addition,
      coal-generated
      power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state.
      ""We don't have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from
      overbuilding in
      the past,"" said Hiniker. ""This is something the PSC should be doing.""
      MG&E's deals are:
      -A 10-year contract to buy 75 megawatts from Calpine Energy Services
      starting in
      May 2004. The power will come from the natural gas-fired plant Rock
      River Energy
      Center, near Beloit.
      Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine
      Energy Corp.
      The plant is being built by Northbrook, Ill.-based SkyGen Energy LLC,
      which
      Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and
      Wisvest Corp.,
      a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp.
      -A 10-year contract to buy 50 megawatts of power from the Rainy River
      Energy
      Corp. starting in May 2002. The power is coming from a natural
      gas-fired plant
      near Joliet, Ill. owned by LS Power Co. Rainy River is a unit of
      Duluth-based
      Minnesota Power Inc.
      -A five-year contract to buy 50 megawatts from an El Paso Merchant
      Energy plant
      near Cordova, Ill., in western Illinois.
      The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center
      Co., which is
      a unit of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings.
      Alliant also offered support in the Wednesday filing for a $7 billion
      plan of
      Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Energy, which includes five new power
      plants in Oak
      Creek and Pleasant Prairie.

The California ISO has leaked to the press that it is filing a study at FERC 
today (presumably this will be part of the ISO's comments regarding FERC 
Staff's Market Mitigation and Monitoring Plan) that shows that five major 
in-state power suppliers -- Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy 
and Mirant (formerly Southern Energy) -- plus 16 power importers have 
overcharged for power.  The ISO's finger appears to be pointed primarily at 
the five major in-state generators

Energy Overcharge of $5.5 Billion Is Alleged

 Power: Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, the state grid 
operator says, citing evidence of market manipulation. Suppliers deny the 
accusation.

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers

     Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5 
billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the 
state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid 
operator said Wednesday.

     Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of 
bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California 
Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings 
support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional 
revenue by manipulating the market.

     Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation.

     The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is 
central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers 
excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis.

     ""This might be the first time we told them the total impact and 
magnitude [of the overcharging],"" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of 
market analysis. ""We think the entire amount deserves consideration for 
refunds.""

     Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity 
sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of 
the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities 
engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices:

     * They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices, 
even though they could have made some money selling more electricity.

     * Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid 
at all.

     The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their 
electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average 
markup in August was 100% during peak hours.

     A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which 
oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to 
comment Wednesday, saying, ""This is part of an ongoing proceeding.""

     FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission 
actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to 
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the 
$5.5-billion total, Massey said: ""That doesn't shock me in any way.""

     ""Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the 
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have 
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,"" he said.

     Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market, 
previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and 
January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds 
of only a tiny fraction of that amount.

     The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy, 
Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus 
16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

     ""All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate 
amounts,"" Sheffrin said.

     Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each 
company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will 
be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how 
much information about the companies will be made public.

     State, U.S. Investigations

     California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power 
in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and 
federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in 
May.

     Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California 
market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or 
through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices.

     Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is 
confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were 
justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company.

     Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units 
so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants. 
These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the 
state.

     Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically 
don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds 
they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of 
the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law.

     In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from 
buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers 
charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the 
listing price in a hot real estate market.

     Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the 
power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by 
FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula 
Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company.

     ""FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are 
made,"" Hill-Collins said. ""This is just a process of justification, not 
necessarily proof of guilt.""

     Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take 
generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or 
refund $10.8 million to California utilities.

     During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California 
Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by 
Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and 
most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state 
Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for 
the three big utilities' 27 million customers.

     The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at 
UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies 
exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices.

     Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said 
Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices 
in 2000.

     ""We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive 
pricing,"" he said. ""When the market was tight this summer, they were able to 
push up prices, and they did.""

     The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found, 
appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per 
megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in 
September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and 
December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used 
to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels.

     ""There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,"" Sheffrin 
said. ""Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted 
itself.""

     Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred 
between May and November.

     On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to 
refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in 
February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430 
per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight 
that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough 
electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.)

     The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69 
million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour.

     Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were 
limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because 
the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more 
than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny.

     ""We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is 
Stage 3 alerts,"" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member 
board (two seats are vacant).

     Generators ""have been given the free and clear,"" he said.

     ""These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are 
almost a joke,"" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the 
Utility Reform Network.

     Resisting Price Caps

     Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can 
no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what 
the market will bear.

     ""FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers' 
own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have 
shown the contrary,"" Sheffrin said. ""We feel FERC needs to look at the 
premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based 
rates.""

     The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable 
electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market 
dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting 
firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation.

     Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to 
use caps across the West as a ""temporary timeout.""

     Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference 
Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to 
cope with California's energy crisis.

     ""If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and 
they'll be worse,"" Abraham said.

     Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff 
recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal 
includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting 
of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to 
costs.

following quoted response that I found.  I will get further clarification.
""In its November 1, 2000, Order, FERC outlined a series of flaws in the
California markets and proposed a number of measured designed to reform the
market.  One of such proposals what that the ISO modify its single price
auction ""so that bids above $150/MWh could not set the market clearing price
that is paid to all bidders and imposing certain reporting and monitoring
requirements for transactions and bids above the $150/MWh breakpoint.""
Pursuant to FERC's November 1 Order, the ISO filed Amendment 33 with FERC on
December 8, 2000, which was approved on the same day.  On December 15, 2000,
FERC issued an Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric
Markets, and further clarified its December 8, 2000 Order.

Pursuant to Amendment 33, effective December 8, 2000, FERC authorized the
ISO to set a ""soft"" bid cap for the purchase of real-time energy.  The order
specified that although the ISO would pay those entities bidding above the
soft cap as bid, all bids above the breakpoint would be are subject to
market refund following FERC's review of the bid data ""in order to ensure
just and reasonable rates"".  Effective December 12, 2000, FERC's order
authorized the ISO to assess the costs of real-time purchases above the soft
cap and allocate to SCs which under-schedule load the difference between the
interval MCP and the bid price above the soft cap bid prices to SCs which
underschedule load.  The ISO created CT 487 to accomplish this allocation.

Please see the following excerpt from the FERC December 15, 2000, order,
Docket No. EL00-95-000, et al:

""On December 8, 2000, the ISO filed Tariff Amendment No. 33 in Docket No.
ER01-607-000, seeking expedited consideration of tariff revisions to address
emergency reliability conditions.  The filing sought three modification of
the ISO's tariff: (1) immediate implementation of an interim price
mitigation proposal based on the breakpoint concept that was proposed in the
November 1 Order (at $250/MWh) to encourage greater participation of
generators in its markets; (2) provision of penalties on generators that
fail to respond to dispatch instructions during a system emergency, to
become effective December 8, 2000; and (3) allocation of the costs of
obtaining additional energy to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISO's
real-time Imbalance Energy market, as an incentive to loads to purchase
energy in the forward markets.  The ISO requested an effective date of
December 12, 2000 for the third modification.

The commission approved the tariff revisions in an order issued December 8,
2000, with the effective dates requested by the ISO.""

After an extensive review, the ISO has concluded that the charges for
purchases above the soft cap break point (currently set at $150/mwh),
although high, are consistent with the filing approved by FERC.  FERC
continues to review the just and reasonableness of all bids dispatched in
our real-time market that are above the $150.00 breakpoint, and will order
market refund if the dispatched bid price is not found to be just and
reasonable.  The ISO continues to review this issue, and is considering
alternative allocation methods, which would continue to be consistent with
the tariff. ""

Thanks for the info Keoni.  I need further clarification.  If the price Cap
went into effect on 12/21/00, how is the CAISO able to charge above the
$150.00 soft price CAP in Uninstructed Energy (407) for 12/22/00-12/31/00?

PG&E balking at Davis' plan
POWER CRISIS 
The utility threatens to take legal action if it is forced to reimburse 
alternative energy producers and the state 
By Andrew LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
SACRAMENTO -- Pacific Gas & Electric raised the threat of legal action Friday 
if the Davis administration follows through with a plan that would force the 
ailing utility to cough up money to alternative energy producers as well 
repay the state for its power purchases. 
The strident stance caught some state officials off guard and led one of Gov. 
Gray Davis' advisers to label it ""negotiating in the paper."" The two sides 
have squared off for more than a month to try to hammer out an agreement that 
would rescue PG&E from its mounting debt. 
The company's resistance to plans that emerged this week in proposed 
legislation and a prospective order to be considered Tuesday by the Public 
Utilities Commission further complicates a difficult situation that appears 
to be growing more tense by the day. 
""These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation,"" said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive of PG&E. ""The numbers just don't work."" 
Company spokesman John Nelson said he could not specify which options the 
utility might pursue. 
And while Smith promised to continue to work with state officials on a 
solution, he said: ""We have a duty to our suppliers, lenders and shareholders 
to protect the assets of the utility, and we must challenge any action by the 
state to force us to pay out more than is collected in rates."" 
Creditors could petition to take Southern California Edison or PG&E into 
bankruptcy at any moment, and some say their patience for a state solution is 
wearing thin. 
Lawmakers moved quickly this week to rescue the alternative generators, known 
as qualifying facilities, after many shut down Monday and helped trigger two 
days of rolling blackouts. The facilities range from geothermal operations 
and wind turbines to natural gas-burning co-generation plants. They produce 
about 30 percent of the state's energy needs this time of year. 
The qualifying facilities quit running because they no longer had cash to pay 
employees and buy goods to keep their plants operating. Southern California 
Edison and PG&E have not paid the facilities for months, and they are owed 
$1.5 billion. 
A bill by Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, sought to give the PUC 
authority to order utility companies to pay the qualifying facilities in 
advance. The measure also would direct utility companies to pay back the 
Department of Water Resources, which has bought power for them since 
mid-January, before paying back others. 
The legislation passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly, where 
Republicans objected to the haste of the action, among other concerns. On 
Friday, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Democrats and 
Republicans would work through the weekend to come up with a plan that could 
win passage Monday. 
Meanwhile, Smith said the approach contained in the legislation would make 
PG&E's finances even worse. The company is collecting $400 million in bills 
each month but owes $1.4 billion a month for energy purchases. 
On Tuesday, Davis called PG&E's and Edison's practice of collecting bills 
from their customers to pay the qualifying facilities and not forwarding the 
money ""immoral."" On Friday, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor 
had nothing more to add. 
Joseph Fichera, a member of the governor's team of advisers negotiating with 
utility companies, said PG&E's refusal to fully pay qualifying facilities 
leads the facilities to shut down, which in turn forces the state to find the 
energy elsewhere. 
""They are still collecting and not paying out the full amount,"" Fichera said. 
""The consequences of that is that it increases the amount of power the state 
has to buy on the spot market and creates a bigger problem for everybody."" 
Fichera said negotiations with Edison and PG&E would continue through the 
weekend. He said there's nothing wrong with PG&E articulating its position, 
but company officials have misjudged the plan and should keep in mind the PUC 
will proceed on the qualifying facilities order in a way the company's 
finances can work. 
""They need to get the QFs online,"" Fichera said. ""They need to see the bigger 
picture that (having) the QFs offline is exacerbating a problem we call 
summer.""

A lone voice for price caps: U.S. regulator fears 'a disaster'
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau 
(Published March 24, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- William Massey used to be a team player. Then the lights 
started flickering in California. 
Now, Massey is the dissenting voice of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission -- a preacher, an absolute convert to the idea that free markets 
be damned because California is getting a raw deal. 
Wholesale electricity prices are rocketing into the stratosphere. Gov. Gray 
Davis, joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington, is screaming for 
price controls. And yet Massey said his colleagues wouldn't do their job to 
ensure ""just and reasonable"" prices and rein in price gougers. 
""I fear a disaster is in the making,"" Massey told a House subcommittee this 
week. He said that without price controls this summer, he fears the worst. 
Massey isn't just pounding the table at congressional hearings. In recent 
orders by the commission, he has been the lone naysayer, uttering in strong 
terms the doom and gloom that will be thrust upon the state by an agency he 
says is refusing to follow the Federal Power Act's mandate that it enforce 
just and reasonable wholesale rates. 
Two weeks ago, Massey condemned as insufficient the commission's order 
finding that a dozen or so power producers may have overcharged California by 
as much as $69 million for January power sales. 
Massey called the commission action ""facially arbitrary, capricious and an 
abuse of discretion."" Massey said his colleagues only focused on power sales 
above $273 a megawatt-hour sold during Stage 3 alerts of imminent rolling 
blackouts. 
""There is no logic to this methodology other than limiting the universe of 
potential refunds,"" Massey wrote. 
Asked about this at the House hearing, Massey was even more pointed. When it 
comes to ferreting out price gougers, Massey said the message is that ""FERC 
is going to be looking for the wallet under the lamp post with the lights 
shining, and nowhere else."" 
These are welcome words to beleaguered state officials and utility executives 
who are growing increasingly frustrated that neither the commission nor the 
Bush administration seems to be heeding the concerns of California and the 
West over the worsening power situation. 
""Commissioner Massey has a very good understanding,"" said an appreciative 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, author of price-control legislation that Massey has 
endorsed. 
Joe Nipper, senior vice president of the American Public Power Association, 
said the fact that Massey is alone in advocating firmer protection for 
California and its consumers makes his role even more important. 
""Thank God he is there to articulate that point of view because if he 
weren't, you wouldn't hear it at all,"" Nipper said. 
Massey concedes that his role as commission dissenter is new. In his eight 
years on the commission, the former legal services lawyer and aide to retired 
Arkansas Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers has been known more as a team player. 
Nominated by President Clinton for the post in 1993, Massey was fully behind 
the notion that free and open markets were the way to go in the energy 
business. 
When California's electric deregulation package started rolling through the 
agency in 1996, Massey was right there, urging it on, proclaiming the glories 
of open competition. 
""It's true that as the commission has marched toward competition in the open 
markets, I've been there in a leadership role,"" Massey said during an 
interview. 
Several Midwest shortages during a 1998 heat wave were the first indications 
that something was amiss. Massey said he was skeptical about the prevailing 
view on the commission that the Midwest problem was the result of ""the 
confluence of a series of circumstances that were unlikely to recur, the 
so-called perfect storm."" 
""I thought that was a naive statement,"" he said. 
But Massey said this didn't shake his confidence in deregulation and 
market-based competition so much as it caused him to doubt the commission's 
ability to handle shifting circumstances. 
""The commission's attitude was that we couldn't go wrong, that competition 
would always be better than the old-fashioned regulatory market and 
essentially that any old market structure would work,"" he said. ""That is 
simply not true."" 
Then came California. 
""I just feel like our actions have been too little, too late all along,"" he 
said. ""As billions of dollars are changing hands, we were studying it. Then 
we are investigating it,"" he said. 
""But for me, competitive markets have to produce just and reasonable prices. 
A dysfunctional market that produces outrageous prices is unlawful. And I 
think my agency has not taken strong enough steps to save California and the 
West from a wildly dysfunctional electricity market."" 
Massey was on the commission when it basically rubber-stamped the California 
deregulation plan, the first in the nation. He said it arrived as a package, 
much of it written into state law, and that the agency did not ask hard 
questions such as how California could get the best price for consumers by 
relying on day-ahead power purchases on the volatile spot market. 
""Essentially we deferred to the market design that was handed to us,"" Massey 
said. ""We did say that it was a work in progress, and that we would be paying 
attention to it. 
But to assume the spot markets would usually produce the lowest prices now, 
in retrospect, seems naive. We are now very critical of that market design 
but we did approve it."" 
Now the commission, with only three of its five seats filled, is led by the 
panel's only Republican, Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to price 
controls. 
The panel's other Democrat, Linda Breathitt, is similarly disposed. 
""I am the lone voice crying in the wilderness,"" Massey said. 
But with the power crisis pushing up wholesale rates throughout the West, 
Massey said this is not the time to be clinging to ideology. 
""I do not think it is worth bringing down the economy of an entire region of 
the country just for the theoretical purity,"" he said.

California's Choices All Look Painful
By LAURA M. HOLSON
OS ANGELES, March 23 * California's energy crisis seems to get worse with 
each passing day.
This week, Californians were once again plunged into darkness as warm weather 
and a large number of shuttered power plants caused blackouts from Santa 
Monica to San Francisco. In offices in and around Sacramento, frenzied 
negotiators continue their months-long talks to design a settlement to keep 
the nearly bankrupt utilities afloat and creditors at bay.
And despite a dizzying 190 bills introduced in the Legislature to address the 
crisis, the bickering among politicians persists. Republican leaders have 
called for the ouster of state utility officials, and California's controller 
warned that the state's general fund was in danger of being frittered away 
unless decisive action was taken. 
Two months ago, Gov. Gray Davis promised a speedy end to the crisis. But all 
the solutions proposed so far seem as fragile and tenuous as the grid itself.
Now a growing chorus of economists, business leaders and policy experts are 
saying what most agree that Mr. Davis will not utter: the state cannot spend 
its way out of this crisis, and politicians are delaying an inevitable, 
albeit unpopular, end * raising retail electricity rates significantly. The 
desire to satisfy all parties is costly and has caused confusion and 
indecision.
""The solution to the policy problem is moving agonizingly slowly because 
there are several powerful political groups that can block any piece of 
legislation,"" said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chief economic adviser in 
the Clinton White House who is now the dean of the Haas School of Business at 
the University of California at Berkeley. ""California's politicians don't 
seem to have enough power or conviction * I think it's power * to get these 
groups to agree."" 
Further, said Steve Fleishman, a Merrill Lynch utility analyst in New York: 
""The government officials keep trying to plug the holes in the dam when they 
spout up. But there are too many things that need to be paid within the 
current utility rate structure."" 
In an interview today, Governor Davis reiterated what he has said for months: 
California's biggest problem is short supply * no major power plants have 
been built in 10 years * and he has invoked his emergency power to put more 
generation online quickly. He warned, too, that state negotiators were 
proceeding with caution to avoid the kind of mistakes the architects of 
deregulation made in the first place. ""One of the reasons we are in trouble 
today was because there was a rush to judgment,"" he said. ""We are not going 
to make that mistake again.""
But for a brief moment recently, it looked as if the state had finally 
marshaled its forces and was well on its way to presenting Californians with 
a cohesive plan. The state treasurer's office hired bankers to help sell a 
$10 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind, that would help pay for 
power now and stabilize prices over time. 
State negotiators hoping to avoid a taxpayer bailout announced a preliminary 
agreement with Southern California Edison to buy its transmission lines for 
about $2.76 billion. And Governor Davis proudly told reporters that his team 
had negotiated a successful round of long-term power contracts that would 
help keep California's lights on. 
But almost every promising announcement has had a less-enticing twist. 
Intense negotiations with the privately-owned utilities drag on week after 
week. Southern California Edison has not finished a deal to sell its 
transmission lines, a necessity if it is to begin paying bills owed since 
November. ""Progress has been made,"" said Bob Foster, Edison's chief 
negotiator. But he warned, ""I don't want to sound overly optimistic.""
Pacific Gas and Electric, for its part, has not announced anything, even in 
principle. John Nelson, a spokesman for the utility, did not return calls 
seeking comment. 
Regarding the long-term power contracts, a report released this week says 
that the state has received commitments for less than half the 6,000 
megawatts it hopes to secure for this summer. The power generators, too, can 
opt out of their contracts for a variety of reasons, including a failure by 
the state to sell bonds by July 1. Governor Davis said today that in most 
cases, much of the energy the state wanted to buy for this summer was no 
longer available. That shortfall could require the state to buy more than 15 
percent of the energy it needs in the expensive spot market, nearly triple 
the amount he once said he wanted. 
Still, the issue that has caused the biggest controversy is who has first 
rights to the money now being collected from ratepayers. (Pacific Gas and 
Electric and Southern California Edison now have $4.4 billion in their 
coffers.) State officials have said that according to the law drafted in 
January to ensure the state could buy power on behalf of the utilities, the 
Department of Water Resources should be paid first. The utilities are saying 
they are first in line. Whatever the outcome, the law's ambiguity has been a 
problem for the state treasurer, Philip Angelides, who said it has not only 
cost him precious time, but could put the bond offering in jeopardy unless it 
is clear how the revenues will be divided. 
""The danger of this is if you let problems like this multiply, the situation 
gets worse and worse,"" he said. California's Public Utilities Commission is 
expected to rule on this issue. (Governor Davis said he expected the 
commission to agree that the state should be paid first.) 
But Mr. Angelides did not want to wait that long. Instead, he said, he and 
his team approached legislators to write another law so he could proceed with 
the state's $10 billion bond offering in May. 
But even then, he contends, the bond offering is only a short-term fix at 
best. ""After the $10 billion is exhausted, we can't keep borrowing and 
borrowing and borrowing,"" Mr. Angelides said. ""The reality is our lack of 
investment in power plants and inability to conserve are going to cost us 
more."" 
Mr. Angelides has a point. But the governor's resistance to raising rates is 
at best a negotiating tool. The governor has told some people that he is open 
to raising rates, but only after the utilities make the concessions he wants, 
people close to the negotiations with the utilities said. It is part of his 
overall strategy, these people said * one that includes building more power 
plants and conserving energy, both crucial in helping California minimize 
disasters this year and next.
But that does little to solve the problem of the $13 billion in debts the 
utilities have already incurred. And that provides little comfort to the 
likes of Hal Dittmer, president and owner of the Wellhead Electric Company, a 
small power generation company in Sacramento, who decided to close down his 
three power plants in February because he had not been paid all the money 
owed by Pacific Gas and Electric. No solution now being discussed, he said, 
either in the legislature or with the utilities themselves, really addresses 
his problem. And like many of the utilities' creditors, he is growing 
impatient.
""The word I would use for what is going on in Sacramento is dithering,"" said 
Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development 
Corporation, who has seen a swarm of recruiters from other states approach 
Los Angeles businesses recently in an effort to woo them away. ""I think what 
they have to understand is that they are putting California's economic future 
at risk."" 
Governor Davis, while sympathetic to his critics' frustrations, dismisses 
them. ""They are viewing the process from afar,"" he said. ""From the 
government's perspective, we are moving at warp speed.""
But that may not be fast enough. Today, in Sacramento, the State Assembly 
rejected a plan that would have allowed smaller power generators, which have 
contracts directly with the utilities, to be paid. Unlike their larger 
counterparts, companies like Mr. Dittmer's do not have their sales guaranteed 
by the state and are themselves threatened by bankruptcy.
The utilities have been negotiating with the smaller generators for months, 
but industry analysts say the two groups are bitter rivals and no agreement 
is likely soon. And to make matters even more precarious, smaller generators 
could be the likeliest to force the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, in 
part, because they want their money and have the least to lose.
""Politics is not just about keeping the lights on,"" Ms. Tyson said. ""It's 
about making sure that all parties are represented."" And that is contrary to 
the business world, she added, ""where it's about getting the job done.""

Local generators win small victory
Filed: 03/24/2001 
By VIC POLLARD, Californian Sacramento Bureau e-mail: 
vpollard@bakersfield.com 
SACRAMENTO -- With help from Kern County's three Assembly members, owners of 
small natural gas-fired generating plants like those in Kern's oil fields won 
a partial victory Friday in their campaign to get paid for the electricity 
they sell to nearly bankrupt utilities. 
Kern County lawmakers helped bury a bill that would have required the big 
utilities to start paying the small generators -- but at a price below what 
it costs them plants to operate. 
The legislation is expected to be taken up in revised form Monday, and Kern's 
lawmakers said they hope it will contain a better deal for the small 
generators. 
The action came at the end of a week of feverish activity sparked by rolling 
blackouts that hit unexpectedly Monday and Tuesday. The blackouts were caused 
partly by the shutdown of many small generating facilities because they have 
not been paid for their electricity in months. 
The crucial vote came late Thursday, when the Assembly's Republicans 
unanimously opposed the low-price payment bill, depriving it of the 
two-thirds vote needed for passage, in the face of heavy pressure from 
Democratic legislative leaders. They wanted to push the bill through 
Thursday, partly because most lawmakers were scheduled to leave Friday on an 
annual lobbying trip to Washington, D.C. 
No one felt the pressure more than Dean Florez of Shafter, the only Democrat 
to vote against the measure. 
""It was really tough,"" Florez said Friday. 
Assemblymen Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield and Phil Wyman of Tehachapi were among 
the Republicans voting against the measure. 
Florez and Ashburn said the main reason they voted no was that the bill would 
have locked in a price for the small generating facilities that would have 
made it impossible for the natural-gas fired plants, and many others, to keep 
operating. 
""If they're losing money generating electricity, they're going to close 
down,"" Ashburn said, adding to the state's shortage of electricity. 
On Friday, after hours of closed-door meetings between Democratic and 
Republican leaders and officials of Gov. Gray Davis' administration, Assembly 
Speaker Robert Hertzberg announced that negotiations would continue and the 
issue would come up again Monday. 
The problem for local lawmakers was that the price established by the 
governor's office, 7.9 cents per kilowatt hour for a five-year contract, is 
anywhere from one-half to one-third of what it costs the gas-fired generators 
to produce electricity because of the current high price of natural gas. 
Under current law, the gas-fired generators are assured of a price for their 
electricity that takes into account fluctuations in the price of natural gas. 
Florez said the price being considered by the PUC would have made it 
economical only for wind- and solar-powered generators.

Enron drops power project 
The move surprises critics and supporters of a Lake Elsinore hydroelectric 
plant. 
By Thomas Buckley
The Press-Enterprise
LAKE ELSINORE
Enron North America has pulled the plug on its plans for a hydroelectric 
power plant in Lake Elsinore. 
Friday's surprise move does not kill the proposal but dims the hopes of 
supporters like the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District for the $450 
million project. 
But opponents, worried about power lines and the potential adverse effect on 
the environment, were overjoyed. 
""That's fantastic,"" said Barbara Bowers, La Cresta resident and member of a 
recently-empaneled project oversight citizen's committee. ""(Enron officials) 
have finally discovered what we knew all along: This was not a viable 
project."" 
While speculation about why Enron backed away from the proposal centered on 
the instability of both the lake and state-power market, company officials 
said their decision was a matter of timing. 
Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth said the timetable for both the hydro plant 
and the 23 miles of power lines that would have been strung along the 
Elsinore Mountains ridgeline was moving much slower than expected, prompting 
the company to re-allocate its resources to other projects in the state. 
""We need to pick up the pace with our power-plant development,"" Russeth said. 
While the water district still holds a three-year preliminary federal permit 
for a hydroelectric project and consultant Nevada Hydro has an agreement with 
the water district, observers say chances are Enron's departure makes the 
project impossible. 
Nevada Hydro is expected to continue work on the project, Enron said, but no 
one close to the project believes the water district and consulting firm can 
pull it off alone. Attempts to contact Nevada Hydro officials were 
unsuccessful. 
""If a company like Enron is not going ahead with this, it is unlikely the 
project will ever be built,"" said county Supervisor Bob Buster. 
But not everyone is willing to throw in the towel on the idea that has been 
in play for a decade, has been declared dead before. 
Dropping the project entirely is ""not an option,"" said water district board 
President Kris Anderson. 
""We've got the permit and we've got three years to get the license to build,"" 
Anderson said. ""I would hate to see the district get out now."" 
Distict officials will met next week to decide how to proceed. 
Wildomar Chamber of Commerce President and citizen's committee member John 
Purpura agreed. 
""It's a sad case and I hope EVMWD can find another company to step into 
Enron's shoes,"" Purpura said. 
In its latest incarnation, the pumped-storage proposal was born last summer 
when Enron first showed an interest. 
The water district was poised to cut its ties to Nevada Hydro, a consulting 
firm long associated with trying to build project, when Enron said it might 
be interested in pursuing the proposal. 
In the following months, Enron, a multi-billion multi-national energy firm, 
spent thousands on research and securing the preliminary federal permit for 
the district. 
People who lived near the lake where the power plant would go were irked by 
what they saw as corporate heavy-handedness, while environmentalists and 
forest residents became alarmed by power line and reservoir construction 
plans. 
The federal permit to pursue a final building license was secured in February 
and the county-backed citizen's committee, after much controversy, had its 
first meeting five days ago. 
Backers have said the project would be a godsend to the lake, providing money 
to buy water to keep it full and to help fund the upcoming $15 million lake 
clean-up. Neither is likely to happen now, observers say. 
""All the expectations they raised have been dashed,"" said Buster, who sits on 
the joint-powers agency in charge of the lake clean-up project. ""They owe the 
community an explanation."" 
Environmentalist activist Gene Frick, who has fought the project for five 
years and once promised to chain himself to an oak tree, was gleeful at 
Enron's decision. 
""I thank you,"" Frick said, ""my associates thank you, and the oak trees thank 
you.""

Jobs at utilities appear safe -- for now 
PUC ruling offers some security at Edison and PG&E, but the threat of 
bankruptcy hovers over many. 
March 24, 2001 
By CATRINE JOHANSSON
The Orange County Register 
Safe for now, but for how long? 
That's the question for thousands of employees at Southern California Edison 
and Pacific Gas & Electric, which are near bankruptcy after paying billions 
more for power over the past 10 months than they could charge customers. 
The utilities hoped to save about $650 million by laying off some 3,000 
employees, but a ruling last week by the state Public Utilities Commission 
halted most of those plans. 
Edison had planned to cut about 2,000 jobs during the course of a year. About 
400 of them were cut in December, while the remaining 1,600 were to be cut 
during 2001. 
Shaun Rolow, a part-time Edison meter reader in Kern County, said he and his 
co-workers feel their jobs are fairly safe, thanks to the PUC ruling, but 
they worry about the future. 
""Most guys are very relieved, but we also talk a lot about the danger of 
Edison going bankrupt,"" he said. ""We feel uneasy, but also try to joke about 
it. Like when we get our paychecks, we joke about whether they'll be any 
good."" 
The 400 employees let go in December were contract workers whose contracts 
were up anyway, said Edison spokesman Steve Hansen. The PUC ruling does not 
reinstate any of those workers. It does, however, prohibit further layoffs in 
customer call centers, meter-reading departments, outage-response teams and 
new-customer connection departments. 
Exactly how many of the 1,600 other jobs are protected by the PUC ruling - 
and how many are not - is unclear, as Edison officials haven't completed 
their analysis of the ruling, Hansen said. 
Of the 1,600, ""less than 50"" were laid off before last week's PUC ruling. 
Whether any of those jobs will be reinstated remains to be decided. 
Steven Carlton, a 20-year Edison employee who is an electricity foreman in 
the Los Alamitos area, said a possible bankruptcy filing for the company is a 
more immediate worry than layoffs. 
""We know that there are too few people to do what we do as it is, so we 
wouldn't get laid off, but we do wonder what's going to happen in the future 
if the company goes bankrupt,"" Carlton said. 
The PUC also rejected the utilities' plans to cut expenses by reading 
electricity meters every other month and using estimated bills for the 
interim months. 
Bimonthly meter readings would, according to the PUC ruling, ""create 
inaccuracies in calculating baseline usage, and consumers will not be able to 
see the results of their conservation efforts."" 
Although the PUC allowed the utilities to continue reducing overtime, Edison 
has decided to pay for overtime work in some cases. 
""We continue to restrict overtime, except in cases where the public or 
employee safety are compromised,"" Hansen said. He would not elaborate on what 
kinds of situations those would be, but acknowledged that the company had 
changed a strict no-overtime policy that left residents of an apartment 
complex in Fountain Valley without electricity for a weekend in January. 
""If a community loses power, we'll send out people to fix it - even if it is 
on the weekend,"" Hansen said. 
The utilities can petition the PUC to change the ruling on layoffs, but 
there's no word yet on whether they will do so. 
""We don't know yet, but we do expect the utilities to appeal,"" said Pat 
Lavin, business manager for Local 47 of the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, which represents 4,100 Edison workers. 
The IBEW is one of the unions in the Coalition of California Utility 
Employees, which filed the grievance with the PUC that prompted the ruling. 
Lavin said the unions watch the situation closely and are prepared to 
challenge future layoff plans by the utilities - regardless of whether the 
targeted employees are union members.

State power regulator proposes 40% rate increase 
Posted at 12:00 noon PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
BY KAREN GAUDETTE 

Associated Press Writer 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent 
hike in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage 
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the 
hot summer months. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates 
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate 
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC 
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by 
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the 
commission. 
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent 
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems 
this summer. 
``That number should be all that is needed going forward,'' she said at a 
news conference, ``to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of 
the state can issue bonds.'' 
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine 
Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary. 
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the 
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already 
scheduled for next year. 
Lynch also supports a ``tiered'' rate system that would charge residential 
and businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back. So 
it should encourage conservation. 
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can 
be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that 
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several 
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate 
increase is inevitable. 
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have 
pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would 
be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's. 
Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San 
Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to 
give the companies cash to pay their bills. 
PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due 
to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law 
prevents them from collecting from their customers.

Calif State Treasurer: Electricity Rate Hike Inevitable

03/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The State of California will have to raise electricity 
rates for consumers to reflect the dramatic price rise seen in the wholesale 
power market, State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Monday in an interview on 
CNBC. 
Angelides declined to specify how much rates would rise from current levels, 
however, and he said that the state's two main investor-owned utilities might 
possibly have to reorganize their financial situation through a bankruptcy 
proceeding.
""It's hard to tell,"" what the percentage of the increase would be, Angelides 
said, ""but there's no mystery that rates are going up. We have to match the 
price of power to what we pay for it to keep the lights on."" 
The rate increase would both curb demand and assure lenders that the state 
will be able to repay the $10 billion in bonds it wants to issue to cover the 
costs of purchasing power. 
As for the utilities, ""It's their job to reorganize themselves inside or 
outside of a bankruptcy proceeding,"" Angelides said, adding that the 
utilities' parent companies greatly benefitted from electric deregulation for 
three years before suffering huge losses in 2000. 
Since the state began buying power on behalf of its two near-bankrupt 
utilities - PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison 
International's (EIX) Southern California Edison - in January, it has spent 
almost $3 billion covering the difference between the utilities' generated 
power and their customers' electricity usage. 
Angelides spoke from New York, where he is trying to convince Wall Street 
bankers to help issue the $10 billion in bonds. The debt issue will provide 
""breathing room to get to a long-term plan by September to balance market 
prices and rates,"" he said. The money will also be used for ""a very dramatic 
conservation program."" 
""If we can get demand down 5% to 10%, we can get power prices down,"" 
Angelides said. 
But the treasurer also said that the merchant power companies in the state 
have acted unconscionably. Reducing demand, he said, will put the state in a 
better position to get the producers to negotiate reasonable long-term prices 
as part of a sustainable solution to the state's power and financial crisis. 
""The first problem is a supply and demand imbalance. If we in California deny 
that we're denying reality. But the other problem is that generators have 
been charging unfair and unreasonably prices,"" said Angelides, who said 
generators have to ""take their foot off our throat and meet us half-way.""

Possible rate hikes cheer California utility investors 
MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer
Monday, March 26, 2001 
,2001 Associated Press 
(03-26) 11:46 PST SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The prospect of substantially higher 
electricity rates in California drew rave reviews Monday on Wall Street as 
investors snapped up the long-suffering stocks of the state's two largest 
utilities. 
With about two hours of trading left on the New York Stock Exchange, shares 
in PG&E Corp. surged $3.80, or 36 percent, to $14.45 while Edison 
International's stock gained $3.79, or 34 percent, to $14.99. 
San Francisco-based PG&E and Rosemead-based Edison International own 
utilities that have been flirting with bankruptcy for months as they paid for 
soaring wholesale electricity costs that couldn't be passed on to customers 
under the state's deregulation law. 
After months of resistance to the idea, state political leaders and 
regulators are poised to swallow a bitter pill and prescribe significant new 
rate increases. 
California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in electricity 
rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customers to cut back 
on usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summer months. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates 
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate 
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The higher rates could go into effect 
as early as Tuesday, when the PUC meets. 
Gov. Gray Davis remains confident the state's power crisis can be resolved 
without further rate hikes, an aide said Monday. But his high-level financial 
aides warned legislative leaders Friday that consumers could feel significant 
pain when all is said and done. 
Although nothing has been completed, news of the likely rate increases leaked 
out during the weekend and raised hopes on Wall Street that the darkest days 
for the two utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California 
Edison, might be behind them. 
The utilities' executives, backed by numerous industry analysts, have 
contended for months that the state needed to approve hefty rate increases to 
ease a power crisis that threatens to make rolling blackouts a routine event 
this summer. 
The higher rates are seen as a way to ease the financial burden of the 
utilities, which say they have run up debts of more than $13 billion buying 
wholesale electricity during the last 10 months. Analysts also reason higher 
electricity bills will persuade more customers to reduce their usage and 
reduce the frequency of blackouts this summer. 
The likely rate increases weren't the only good news for utility shareholders 
Monday. 
Over the weekend, Southern California Edison said it will resume payments to 
alternative energy providers known as ``qualifying facilities'' -- a move 
expected to reduce the chances that the disgruntled generators will band 
together and try to force the utility into bankruptcy. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, Pacific Gas and 
Electric disclosed that it had received more breathing room from some of its 
key creditors. The utility has defaulted on a $1 billion revolving credit 
line, but the banks that made the loans have given the company until April 13 
to work things out, the filing said. 
PG&E also revealed that its electricity losses could result in a $4.1 billion 
charge against its fourth-quarter earnings.

Duke says would take less for California power sales 
Posted at 11:55 a.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
NEW YORK, (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp. said Monday it would take less money 
for power it sold to California customers during January and February, 
provided it receives guarantees it will get paid. 
Responding to accusations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
that it overcharged its California customers by $17.8 million during power 
shortages in January and February, Duke said in a statement that the prices 
it charged were ''reasonable'' given the high risks that generators would not 
be paid. 
In a filing with FERC Friday, Duke President and Chief Executive Officer Jim 
Donnell said, ``We could be willing to forgo collection of the credit 
premiums for these months, provided we receive the FERC clearing price.'' 
California's Independent System Operator, which covers 75 percent of the 
state's power grid, has accused generators of overcharging customers by $6.2 
billion since May. 
Houston-based Duke said that during the months of January and February its 
bids included a credit premium to cover the ''substantial risk'' of 
nonpayment. Duke said the credit premium and market condition were 
responsible for its bids exceeding the FERC determined market clearing price. 
FERC had set a $273 megawatt per hour cap on power sales to California during 
the Stage 3 emergencies in January and February. 
Shares of Duke were up $1.27, or more than 3 percent, to $39.15 in afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared to a 52-week high of 
$45.2188 and low of $24.8750.

Power Woes Raise Questions Over Control of Gas Pipelines
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN
arly last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen 
companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from 
Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved 
California. 
The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, 
which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso 
Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, 
in total, for bits and pieces.
Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint 
against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer 
is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its 
sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of 
natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. 
According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of 
filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally 
that the deal would give them ""more control"" of gas markets, including the 
""ability to influence the physical market"" to benefit the company's financial 
positions.
El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response 
to California's complaint, said the state ""grossly distorted"" company 
documents by quoting words and phrases out of context.
The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the 
natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric 
power plants.
At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive 
abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal 
regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry 
officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor 
unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize 
profits.
More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, 
moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to 
fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. 
Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But 
experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New 
England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. 
In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in 
the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy 
crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from 
price manipulation and profiteering.
""They are the market maker with this pipeline,"" said Loretta Lynch, the 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled 
to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. 
El Paso ""sets the price in California,"" Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was 
intentional. ""It has affected the price,"" she said, ""for everything related 
to heat and electrical power prices in the state."" 
California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant 
""has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity"" on 
the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's 
owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to 
other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said 
that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit 
anticompetitive behavior.
The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to 
make money by widening the ""basis spread"" * the difference between what gas 
can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of 
the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California.
As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price 
of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that 
pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 
billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 
months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup 
the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically 
is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in 
the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas- New Mexico price in 
December.
To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations 
of market manipulation are ludicrous. 
High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are 
easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's 
utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or 
store enough gas for winter.
""The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,"" 
said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North 
America. 
Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific 
Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in 
a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed 
company documents. 
""It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy 
Corporation,"" the utility said in the filing, ""that the business strategy El 
Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue 
involved manipulation of price spreads."" 
The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal 
between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the 
agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry 
observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as 
the agency's public meeting on Wednesday.
Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said 
recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of 
the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option 
that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic 
feet of gas a day. 
Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the 
chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that 
their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement.
Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ""gut-wrenching"" decision, Mr. 
Smith said, but was ""a first- class gesture"" to California. El Paso Merchant 
paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until 
May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that 
investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative.
""No doubt about it,"" Mr. Clark said, ""we made good money."" 
The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is 
expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The 
company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los 
Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent 
pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso 
denied the accusation.
With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about 
anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created 
soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. 
Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints 
to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing 
capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California.
In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline 
companies routinely favored affiliates. ""Abuses abound because of financial 
windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased 
complexity of the market,"" the company said.
""There are some red flags right now,"" said William L. Massey, a member of the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was 
troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and 
power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural 
gas. El Paso is in all those businesses.
""What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at 
work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand 
signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of 
affiliate abuse?"" he said. 
Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. 
""There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,"" said 
Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron 
Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which 
California has brought its complaint about El Paso.
To its critics, El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns. It operates the 
nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest 
reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal 
Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market 
capitalization of $32 billion. 
At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts 
heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's 
much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is 
expected to earn about $1.4 billion.
El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's 
profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it 
is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest 
quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ""commodity 
market and trading margins"" that were enhanced by ""power price volatility, 
particularly in the Western United States."" 
Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According 
to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was 
awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. 
Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the 
bid. 
The presentation outlined what it termed ""strategic advantages,"" including 
""more control of total physical markets"" and the ""ability to influence the 
physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,"" according to 
the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to 
give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support 
financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its 
risk.
For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation 
said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. 
Under the heading ""Challenges,"" according to the sealed filings, the 
presentation stated that storage was needed ""to help manipulate physical 
spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.""
On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at 
the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update 
for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ""We will make 
money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread."" 
The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by 
increasing the gas flow in the pipeline * the load factor * while increasing 
the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it 
could be sold for at the other end * the basis spread.
In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the 
unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in 
months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices 
in the spot market. 
Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the 
pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in 
prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso 
Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last 
year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices.
The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in 
the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal 
regulators, said California's complaint had ""misconstrued and incorrectly 
interpreted"" what it termed ""snippets of data.""

SoCal Edison To Pay QFs On Going-Forward Basis

03/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

ROSEMEAD, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's (EIX) Southern 
California Edison unit said that, in anticipation of pending action by the 
California Public Utilities Commission to restructure the way qualifying 
facility generators, or QFs, will be paid, the utility will resume payments 
to QFs on a going-forward basis. 
In a press release Sunday, Southern California Edison said it has set aside 
funds in a separate account and will make payments in advance of expected 
April deliveries.
Payment processing would begin immediately after the CPUC approves on Tuesday 
a proposed decision to restructure QF prices. 
Advance payments will be based on the generators' historical production level 
and the PUC's pricing order. 
The company said it will be able to make payments only up to ""an aggregate 
amount that is available to us from rates actually received for QF payments."" 

Southern California Edison said that ""in recognition of the state's need for 
all the electricity it can get during these times, SCE is hereby instituting 
a program to pay those QFs that continue to provide electricity to the 
utility."" 
The company is ""leaving it up to the discretion of the"" PUC ""as to how the 
payment structure will be revamped and how we should allocate the payments to 
QFs."" 
The PUC will likely approve a 20% rate increase for Southern California 
Edison and PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric on Tuesday, ending a 
three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners told Dow Jones 
Newswires on Saturday. 
The increase also would let utilities start paying small independent power 
producers on a forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, 
the commissioners said. 
PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their

Legislative firebrand Burton plays hardball in debate over power 
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PST Sunday, March 25, 2001 
BY HALLYE JORDAN 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- It didn't take long for perpetually impatient John Burton to 
size up the conference call as a waste of time. 
Twenty minutes and four curses into the conversation, the president pro tem 
of the state Senate announced to the utility company executives, outgoing 
Clinton Cabinet members and top state officials that he was putting down the 
phone -- to shave. 
Five minutes later, he stashed his Gillette Mach 3 and returned to the phone. 
As he suspected, ``I didn't miss a thing.'' 
Welcome to the world of John Lowell Burton, perhaps the state's most 
powerful, colorful and combative legislator. That Burton has ascended to the 
top rung of political power in California surprises many, and perhaps no one 
more than Burton himself. 
The 68-year-old product of old school San Francisco politics has a penchant 
for profanity and a demeanor that ricochets from volatile to gruff to goofy. 
He fought a well-publicized battle against cocaine addiction that threatened 
to end not only his political career but his life. Burton not only survived, 
he thrived -- a die-hard liberal somehow succeeding in an age of centrism. 
He has prevailed in part by balancing the two sides of his political persona: 
the idealistic progressive and the pragmatic deal-maker. 
Idealistic though he may be, Burton has a healthy appetite for hard-ball 
politics. He's been known to abandon longtime supporters in favor of economic 
special interests when it was politically expedient. He has a knack for 
fundraising that makes political reformers blanch. And he delights in 
jousting with the state's moderate Democratic governor, Gray Davis. 
In his fourth year as Senate president pro tem, the second most powerful post 
in Sacramento, Burton is up to his gold wire-rims and gray-flecked eyebrows 
in the debate over rolling blackouts and energy industry bailouts. 
The crisis has proved vexing for the veteran pol. Consumer groups are among 
his most ardent supporters. Yet Burton feels compelled to find a way to keep 
the lights on -- even though that means helping the cash-strapped utilities 
that consumer groups love to hate. 
It hasn't been easy. On Thursday, he showed his frustration with the 
utilities during a Senate debate: ``I hope they go bankrupt. Let them go 
belly up. I don't care anymore.'' 
Earlier in the session, Burton introduced a bill that would set up a state 
power authority to help finance construction of new power plants. Another 
bill he pushed would authorize the state to purchase electricity lines from 
its cash-strapped utilities for at least $7 billion. 
The subject of ongoing negotiations between the utilities and Davis, the 
transmission line deal is intended to give taxpayers a valuable asset while 
helping utility companies stay on their feet. ``If you go broke,'' Burton 
said, ``you sell your car or you hock your watch.'' 
Republicans see Burton's plan as yet another example of big government run 
amok. 
``He has that basic philosophy that says government wants to run 
everything,'' said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. 
Burton grew up on the outskirts of the Sunset district in San Francisco, the 
youngest of three boys. His mother was a no-nonsense woman who, when her 
husband refused to buy her a fur coat or a car, worked two jobs to purchase a 
mink and a used blue Buick convertible. 
His father was a doctor who practiced in poor neighborhoods and instilled in 
his sons a gnawing need to help those less fortunate. 
He is obviously his parents' child: The closets of his Potrero Hill home are 
stuffed with suede jackets and tailored slacks that he regularly rotates into 
the back seat of his car, where they are within easy reach in case he passes 
a homeless shelter or some suffering soul on the street who looks his size. 
``My whole thing is caring for people on the edge that nobody gives a 
(expletive deleted) about,'' Burton said. 
Subtle, he is not: During the height of the debate over welfare reform, he 
chided his peers for slashing welfare benefits by introducing a bill that 
would have made it a crime to be poor. 
Burton believes his party has sold out the disenfranchised in its quest to 
capture the moderate middle. 
``Who stands for anything anymore?'' he sputters with an expletive. ``What's 
wrong with making sure all kids have medical insurance?'' 
He seems to revel in his reputation as the only lawmaker willing to take on 
the state's centrist governor. Their clashes are frequent, and Davis' staff 
keeps a wary eye on Burton. 
Last year, Davis proposed a scholarship program to reward high-achieving 
students. Fearing the plan would siphon money from an existing program that 
provides scholarships for poor students, Burton and a bipartisan group of 
senators linked Davis' proposal to one expanding scholarships based on 
financial need. 
That meant both would become law if Davis signed either one. Burton said the 
bill was the brainchild of all, but it bore his name for one reason: ``I 
didn't want the governor to (expletive deleted) with it,'' he said. Davis 
didn't. 
Burton followed in the footsteps of his oldest brother, Phillip, a powerful, 
legendary congressman who died in 1983. 
John Burton spent 10 years in the Assembly and was elected to Congress in 
1974. He served eight years before cocaine addiction forced him out of 
politics and into a Scottsdale rehab clinic. 
At some point, Burton said, he just got sick of doing drugs in any of the 
dozens of anonymous Washington, D.C., hotel rooms he called home. 
``Finally,'' he said, ``it seemed to make a lot more sense to get some 
treatment than be dead, or have a breakdown, or be in jail.'' 
His drug days return only in occasional dreams in which the cocaine 
inevitably gets stuck in a straw or spills on the carpet. 
Today, Burton's lone addiction is caffeine -- he regularly downs at least 
four cappuccinos in the morning, insisting on extra-firm foam. And he may 
have three Diet Cokes, each with a slice of lemon, during dinner. 
For six years after his drug rehabilitation, Burton lived in San Francisco, 
staying straight, playing racquetball, sunning on the deck of his home with 
its sweeping vista of the downtown skyline. 
He indulged in movies and made good money as a corporate lawyer. He also 
played the stock market, accumulating wealth he pegs at $1.5 million, but 
that financial disclosure statements indicate ranges between $1.7 million and 
$7.2 million. 
From Gap Inc. to Wal-Mart, Burton's portfolio is impressive, if incongruous: 
This self-styled voice of the common man owns stocks in huge pharmaceutical, 
high-tech, communications and oil and gas companies. 
But his stock holdings are no more surprising than the fact that attorney 
Burton, the champion of consumer issues, was once on retainer for Pacific Gas 
& Electric Co. 
In 1988, politics came knocking again. Burton's old Assembly seat was open, 
and his pal, then Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, desperately needed allies to 
help squelch rebel Democrats who were challenging his control. 
``No (expletive deleted) way,'' Burton replied three times before finally 
relenting -- and winning. 
Eight years later, he was elected to the Senate. Two years after that, his 
colleagues chose him to serve in the state's highest legislative post, Senate 
president pro tem. 
While his personality and political instincts helped win him the spot, 
another asset propelled Burton to victory: His ability to raise boatloads of 
campaign cash. 
He turns even chance encounters into potentially profitable conversations. In 
early December, a friend who ran into Burton in a San Francisco restaurant 
mentioned that he'd dropped off a Christmas gift at Burton's office. The 
senator didn't skip a beat. ``Is it cash?'' he asked with a quick grin. 
Even people who detest Burton's politics tend to like the man. 
The Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition said there isn't a 
legislator he disagrees with more on hot-button topics such as gay rights and 
abortion. Still, he can't help but enjoy sparring with Burton. 
No `stuffed shirt' 
``He's not a stuffed shirt,'' Sheldon said. ``He doesn't double-talk you.'' 
Twice divorced, Burton met his first wife in 1963 at a meeting in the home of 
Vince Hallinan, the famed San Francisco civil rights lawyer. She was the 
daughter of a labor leader who organized plantation workers and longshoremen 
in Hawaii. Married for seven years, they had one daughter, Kimiko Burton, the 
acting San Francisco public defender. He remarried in 1975, and divorced in 
1981. 
These days, as he makes his way through the Capitol, Burton often plays the 
gracious flirt, chatting up female lobbyists and colleagues. The next moment, 
he might be blowing up at someone, yelling four-letter words that echo down 
the high-ceilinged corridors and force staffers to keep his office doors shut 
so as not to offend touring school children. 
State Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Los Angeles, once joked that Cal-Tech had 
developed an ``FPM'' scale for the number of obscenities Burton spews per 
minute. ``More than 50 FPMs,'' she said, ``and John is really, really mad. 
Less than 10, check his breathing.'' 
Beneath the bluster is a shrewd politician who can grasp the high points of 
the most complex subjects, instruct his staff to figure out the details and 
seal the deal with his word. As one pundit put it, Burton is the guy who 
can't read a map, but never gets lost. 
Consider 1998, Burton's first year as Senate leader. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson 
and the Republicans wanted to slash the state's hefty vehicle license tax as 
a way to share California's $4.4 billion budget surplus. But Burton and the 
Democrats wanted to earmark the money for the needy who had taken cuts during 
the recession. 
Burton's staff devised a plan to phase in the tax cuts over several years, 
but only if the state was rolling in money. That protected revenues for the 
Democrats' pet projects, while giving Wilson bragging rights to a huge tax 
cut. 
`Safe' seat for a liberal 
Being a larger-than-life liberal in the nation's most liberal city provides a 
sense of security that few other politicians enjoy. Burton hasn't faced a 
serious political challenge since the 1960s, and occupying a ``safe'' seat 
allows him to carry controversial, special-interest bills -- even when they 
tick off his core supporters. 
Burton paid scant attention when environmentalists opposed his efforts to 
make it easier to fill in the San Francisco Bay for runway expansions at San 
Francisco International Airport. He shrugged off criticism about a bill he is 
carrying that would benefit a large campaign donor who owns an out-of-state 
gambling facility. And he alienated campaign finance reform advocates by 
pushing a campaign contribution and spending limits initiative that they said 
was too permissive. 
Consumer groups chafed at one of Burton's first legislative responses to the 
energy crisis: using $400 million of taxpayer money to buy electricity for 
the cash-strapped utilities. Still, they turn to Burton. 
``Every morning when I get up, for the last two months, I say a little prayer 
for John Burton,'' said consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield. ``If there is 
going to be one hero in this four-year deregulation debacle, it's going to be 
John Burton.'' 
Those who watched Burton pull back from the brink of self-destruction and 
stage his political comeback have seen him work magic before. They hope he 
has one trick left to solve the energy mess. Burton says the crisis is the 
most daunting political problem he has faced in his long career. 
``I don't think I have the power or the ability to put the toothpaste back in 
the tube,'' Burton said with a shrug. ``But we're working on it.''

Web of power intrigue alleged 
Many say generators shared data on the Internet to exploit the market. 
March 25, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
Power producers selling electricity to California's fledgling deregulated 
market shared confidential data that allowed them to watch one another's 
every move - giving them leverage to drive up prices and helping to launch 
the state last spring into its energy crisis, records and interviews show. 
The information provided a picture of the state's electricity grid in motion: 
The amount of electricity being generated, price bids for electricity, the 
location of units down for repairs, schedules of electricity delivery over 
transmission lines, and the location of transmission bottlenecks. 
It was all done over the World Wide Web. 
Most of the Web sites have been shut down, amid allegations that the 
information was used to ""game,"" or manipulate, the electric market and gouge 
Californians out of billions of dollars while bringing the state's largest 
utilities to the brink of bankruptcy and prompting rolling blackouts. 
At least one site remains, and negotiations to resurrect another 
controversial site are under way, frustrating consumer groups and antitrust 
lawyers who contend the power producers have found new means to collude, 
using state-of-the-art computer technology. 
""Openness and willingness to share information was turned against us and used 
to manipulate the market rather than to bolster the market,"" said consumer 
advocate Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network. 
""It's a lesson that is going to cost billions of dollars."" 
The data sharing began as a way to ensure the smooth operation of the state's 
electrical grid, by giving timely information to all the people in the 
market: power producers, utilities, those operating the grid. 
In recent weeks, federal and state regulators have accused the power 
companies of charging too much and manipulating the market. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 13 power generators to 
justify their prices or pay nearly $70 million in refunds. 
It also accused two producers with Orange County operations of creating 
scarcity and gouging by as much as $10.8 million. 
Last week, the California Independent System Operator, which manages three- 
quarters of the state's electricity grid, filed a complaint with federal 
officials alleging that 21 power producers overcharged the state by $6.8 
billion since May 2000. 
Power producers have routinely called the investigations ""witch hunts"" and 
believe they will conclude with officials seeing that normal market 
conditions - not market manipulation - led to the high prices. They say the 
data from Web sites were used to help manage their work and design trading 
strategies -- all legally. 
""It's no different from putting together a weather forecast,"" said Randy 
Hickok, man aging director of California assets for Duke Energy Corp. 
""You use the information to determine your trading strategy."" 
Live data feeds on output, transmission 
A review of a dozen studies and investigations into California's electricity 
market, coupled with interviews with more than 20 economists, antitrust 
experts, Web site designers, power merchants and utility officials reveals a 
key flaw in the market: It hinged on instant communications over the 
Internet. 
By the summer of 1999, three main Web sites were online and being used by the 
power producers. 
One was operated by the Western Systems Coordinating Council - which includes 
power merchants from 17 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico. The 
council oversees the smooth flow of power around the West. This private site 
went offline in October 2000. It provided live data that showed the most 
detailed information available on generation and transmission of electricity. 
The site might be revived. The council has paid for a new software package to 
get direct feeds from power producers, and talks are under way. 
Another private, now-defunct Web site, which was run by the exchange that 
until January organized California's hourly energy auctions, provided live 
data showing energy up for auction, bidding prices, and when the bids were 
accepted. 
Still another site - The Open Access Same-Time Information System, or OASIS, 
provides data for the day- ahead market that shows how much capacity is 
available on transmission lines so generators can figure out what paths to 
use to deliver electricity. 
The OASIS site still provides data about bottlenecks that can affect prices. 
However, this has caused less concern because it can't be acted on 
immediately. It's only used for bids for the next day's market, and by then 
congestion could be cleared. The Web sites offered rows of numbers in charts 
and tables. The power traders downloaded the data into computer programs that 
spit out maps of the electricity grid that were updated every few seconds. 
Traders could view the maps as they bought and sold energy off the 
trading-room floors - expansive rooms loaded with computers, scrolling 
tickers and huge televisions tuned to the Weather Channel. 
The California Power Exchange, which held the energy auction, in April 1998 
identified five merchants that were dominating the market. They were Williams 
Cos., Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc., Sempra Energy and Duke. 
The question at the heart of a series of state and federal inquiries is 
whether the power producers conspired or colluded to fix prices at inflated 
rates, or whether market conditions prompted them to mirror one another's 
bidding strategies. 
Price-fixing is illegal, a violation of federal and state antitrust laws, 
which were established to ensure that fair competition drives the price for 
goods and services. 
No smoke-filled rooms, lawyer says 
San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre and another team of lawyers, suing on behalf 
of the city of San Francisco, say the Web sites were a new kind of collusion, 
made possible by two things: a market dominated by just a few players, and 
technology that allowed those players to view the same live data in the same 
format. 
Aguirre said they knew this would make it possible to take the same actions 
to drive up prices. The Web sites were part of the plan, and it worked, he 
said. 
""They are now marching lockstep and communicating in the way a cartel 
communicates, only they are actually much more sophisticated - you aren't 
going to catch them together in some smoky room,"" said Aguirre. 
By the time the two main sites were shut down because of complaints that they 
were being used to drive up prices, the generators had a lock on the market 
and understood the nuances of how to manipulate it, he said. The Independent 
System Operator believes the Web site data were used last summer to ""exercise 
market power and (for) gaming in the real market."" The accusation was made in 
an Oct. 10 letter to owners of the coordinating council Web site. 
State power grid officials said they routinely saw power producers triple 
their prices within minutes of a bottleneck on a transmission line. Kellan 
Fluckiger, the grid's operations vice president, likened it to a closure on a 
state highway that might give businesses - that know they are the final stop 
for bread or water - the incentive to mark up prices and take advantage of a 
captive clientele. 
""We saw generators on the right side of the congestion change their bids from 
$50 a megawatt(-hour) to $150 immediately after there was a clog in the 
line,"" said Fluckiger. 
Another strategy to create price spikes, according to grid manager Jim 
Detmers, was to intentionally pull generators offline to create scarcity. 
Reliant Energy Vice President John Stout said neither his company nor his 
competitors used the Web site data to fix electricity prices. 
""There are two sides to this. On the one hand you can say that people were 
able to quickly start up their generators to keep the lights on,"" Stout said. 
""On the other hand you can say that someone kept generators offline to 
extract more money. But that didn't happen. Shutting down a generator when 
there's an opportunity to sell energy isn't a wise thing to do."" 
Utility executives - who bought power from the generating companies - have 
fought for the live data to be restricted to those responsible for managing 
the transmission lines. For everyone else, they want it embargoed for a week 
or more. 
""A delay should be enough to prevent real-time action - using the information 
to create congestion or to take advantage of bottlenecks - but would allow 
for analysis later,"" said Gary Stern, director of market monitoring and 
analysis for Southern California Edison. 
Consumer groups say they are shocked the live data were being shared, because 
power merchants have fought the release of the information to regulators 
investigating the market. 
""The mantra of the energy industry is, 'All this information is protected as 
a trade secret. Regulators, the government, the public can't see any of it 
because it would give competitors too much information,' "" said consumer 
advocate Doug Heller. ""But internally the companies seem to be more than 
happy to share and have access to crucial market data as a tool to manipulate 
the market."" 
Southwestern University law professor Lawrence Sullivan, a national antitrust 
expert, said antitrust cases are tough to prove. Sometimes there is no 
collusion, just a group of individuals or companies presented with similar 
conditions, all reacting in the same way. He uses a rainstorm analogy. 
""Suddenly it starts raining; you put your umbrella up and so does everyone 
else,"" said Sullivan. ""You are acting for you own reasons and you don't care 
if anyone else puts their umbrella up. You are doing it for yourself."" 
Equal data sharing in 'transparent market' 
From the regulators' perspective, the only requirement on data-sharing is 
that it be done equally, so that all market participants can take advantage 
of it. Moreover, the federal commission actually requires the OASIS site. 
Commissioner William Massey said the economic principle driving the 
commission's philosophy is that sharing information, or having a ""transparent 
market,"" should foster healthy competition. But Massey concedes California 
has too few players and not enough electricity to have a truly competitive 
market. 
Stanford University economist Frank Wolak - who does market surveillance 
studies for the grid operator - said people expected that federal regulators 
would protect consumers by setting price caps if the market became unwieldy, 
allowing flaws in the market to be worked out. 
He blames federal regulators rather than generators. 
Generators' ""job is to maximize profits. It's like asking a predator not to 
seek its prey,"" said Wolak. ""Lions are supposed to eat zebras, but the game 
warden is supposed to do something if they are eating too many zebras. FERC 
has an obligation to do something if the prices are going to kill the 
California economy.""

Studies show pitfalls in power market 
Investigators believe the deregulated system has opened itself up to 
manipulation of supply and pricing. 
March 25, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
Nearly a dozen studies and investigations have found evidence of flaws and 
weaknesses in California's deregulated electricity market that - if detected 
and rooted out earlier - could have prevented the state from spiraling into 
crisis. 
A growing number of lawmakers, energy regulators and academic experts believe 
power producers exploited these weaknesses to ""game"" the market. 
Earlier this month, the state Senate formed an investigative committee to 
determine if energy producers illegally manipulated the market. The move came 
less than a week after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered power 
producers to refund nearly $70 million for energy sold in January, unless 
they can justify the prices charged. In other words, for the first time the 
onus is on the generators: They must prove they didn't manipulate the market. 
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who will chair the new investigative 
committee, has reviewed piles of evidence collected against the power 
producers and believes it's time to determine whe ther Californians have 
become victims of a new energy cartel. 
""Not only is there a grassy knoll, there are many who believe the gunman is 
still standing there firing,"" said Dunn, an attorney who has successfully 
litigated against the tobacco industry for engaging in unfair business 
practices. 
The market flaws that allowed for manipulation include: 
The ""crazy auction."" That is how Gov. Gray Davis described the state's daily 
energy market when the crisis hit. The auction guaranteed that every seller 
would get paid the last bid price. The model was supposed to encourage power 
producers to bid early to avoid being locked out when the utilities had 
enough electricity lined up. But sellers never did fill the energy needs 
early in the day, so by the time the market was about to close, buyers had 
increased their bidding price in an effort to secure enough energy. As a 
result, the sellers were always awarded the highest bid price - even if 90 
percent of the energy had been secured at a lower rate earlier in the day. 
Lack of generation. The California Energy Commission says the state's 
consumption grew by no more than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000, leading many to 
argue that scarcity alone could not have driven the market so out of control. 
However, economists say it may have contributed to the problem. Here's why: 
even with the commission's projections - which are disputed by generators who 
place increases at closer to 20 percent - the rate of consumption was nearly 
equal to the rate of generation. Economists say a healthy market for 
ratepayers will only come when generation exceeds consumption by at least 20 
percent. 
Instant updates. The ability to see real-time, market-sensitive information 
allowed power producers maximum potential for com mand ing the highest 
possible price. Two Web sites in particular allowed generators to see what 
their competitors were up to, minute by minute, as they bought and sold 
energy. The information-sharing is at the heart of two lawsuits filed against 
the power producers, accusing them of violating antitrust laws to fix prices. 
Producers say they did nothing wrong. 
Regulatory gaps. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had the power to 
step in and set caps to stabilize the market. The idea was to allow the 
private energy suppliers to make profits, but not at rates that will harm the 
economy. The decision not to use this authority emboldened the merchants, 
resulting in increased profits from 1999 to 2000 of more than 300 percent, 
according to consumer groups and a state Independent System Operator filing 
with the federal commission. 
Too few sellers. Even when production levels climb, economists say, the 
marketplace will be better served if more players are introduced. Most of 
California's energy needs have been met by five major suppliers, each having 
about 20 percent of the state's business. Energy and antitrust experts say 
it's too easy to mirror one another's actions and form a mon opoly with a 
group of sellers this small. 
Abrupt shift to a new market. The state didn't build safety bridges from the 
old system to the new. For example, in other states where deregulation has 
been enacted, the utilities sold off their power generators, but only on the 
condition that the new buyers sell them electricity at a locked-in, low rate 
for the first few years. Economists say this would have helped stabilize 
costs until the new market was established. 
Dunn's committee will look at ways to restructure the marketplace so that 
prices can stabilize. But a second goal is to determine whether power 
generators have criminally exploited weaknesses in the marketplace. 
The power generators say they've endured scrutiny in studies and state and 
federal investigations, and that no proof of criminal wrongdoing was found. 
""There have been at least nine investigations that have looked at this ... 
including a federal investigation,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director 
of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade organization for power 
generators. ""To date no one has concluded there is any illegal activity or 
any other kind of misconduct."" 
But Dunn, antitrust experts - and even the researchers -- said these repeated 
claims by power producers and their representatives misstate what the studies 
show. 
Here's why: The academic studies and market surveillance reports never aimed 
to prove illegal activity. Instead their goal was to determine if the Federal 
Power Act needed to be enacted by FERC. The act requires that the federal 
regulators step in when evidence of market power, or monopoly power over 
prices, is being exercised by the generators -something that nearly every 
study found. 
""Their only job is to look at if the market is dysfunctional,"" said Dunn. 
""They are not looking at it through the lens of a prosecutor."" 
MIT economist Paul Joskow said his work shows that supply and demand 
scenarios could not possibly have led to the prices Californians have been 
paying for electricity. Market power had to be exerted, but he said he didn't 
have the power to subpoena documents or witnesses that might have revealed 
illegal activity. 
""My objective was not to determine if anyone engaged in illegal behavior,"" 
said Joskow, who conducted research that was funded by Edison International. 
""It was designed to assist FERC ... then it was up to FERC to decide the 
implications in enforcing the Federal Power Act, which requires that they set 
just and reasonable prices."" 
Joskow's work showed that prices, in many instances, were twice as high as 
they should have been. 
Stanford University economist Frank Wolak, who heads a team of economists 
that conducts regular market surveillance reports for California's main 
electricity grid operator, said he has repeatedly found evidence of market 
manipulation and reported it to FERC. 
In 2000 alone, Wolak said, his work showed that market manipulation accounted 
for an $8 billion overcharge out of the $27 billion that was paid for 
electricity in the California market. 
However, no action was ever taken by federal officials. 
""It's frustrating because they say, 'Be very vigilant in searching for market 
power,' but when we find it, they don't do anything,"" Wolak said. ""They say, 
'Oh no, that's not market power.' If they would define what market power is, 
we would be looking for it. But I don't think they want us to find it."" 
Wolak said he believes that recent actions by federal officials - in which 
they have ordered refunds - represent a token gesture and are a response to 
intense public pressure for them to act. So far, they've identified less than 
$80 million in potential overcharges, compared with the billions that Wolak 
and others have identified. 
One federal commissioner agrees with Wolak. Commissioner William Massey said 
the commission has resisted stepping in and using its authority because it 
believed the free market would correct itself. Massey said members are 
beginning to intervene, but he, too, believes the actions should be more 
aggressive. 
""We have been the beneficiaries of countless market monitoring reports for 
two or three years now. Very sophisticated reports that have talked about the 
existence of market power,"" Massey said. ""I think we should have heeded those 
warnings. I think we should have done a better job."" 
Last year, FERC did its own investigation to determine if power producers 
were conspiring and intentionally taking generators offline to drive up 
prices. But that study - often cited by power generators as proof that they 
have been cleared of wrongdoing - was cursory. 
FERC described the work as an ""informal investigation"" and said at the 
beginning of the report that it did not subpoena witnesses or documents. Most 
of the work was done over the telephone with a few power plants subjected to 
scheduled inspections. 
""That FERC study was ridiculous,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute. ""They asked (the power producers) 
if they were manipulating. I guess I wasn't surprised by their answer."" 
Attorneys who have accused the power producers of breaking anti-trust laws 
said they are using the academic studies to help them with their own 
investigations. 
But they serve as a starting point. 
The lawyers are looking at the evidence found by researchers - why they 
believed the market was being manipulated - and will subpoena the necessary 
people and records to see if there is proof that illegal actions were behind 
the manipulation. 
""It's not all in one place, and it's not sitting on a silver platter, but we 
believe it's out there,"" said Len Simon, an attorney working on the city of 
San Francisco's lawsuit filed against power producers. ""They (academic 
researchers) have found evidence that these high prices are not purely the 
result of market forces, but they have not been able to secure conclusive 
proof. That's what we plan to do.""

Headed toward 'disaster' 
Analysts: California fails in bid to get handle on crisis
By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- Big power rate hikes. Dangerous rolling blackouts. Volatile 
utility bankruptcies. 
For months, all were deemed nightmares to be thwarted at virtually any cost. 
Yet now they all appear likely, even inevitable, according to experts who see 
California tumbling from an energy crisis into something worse. 
""We're getting closer andcloser to a situation that could be described as a 
disaster for the state,"" said James Swee-ney, director of Stanford 
University's energy institute. 
Energy woes are starting to hinder California's economy, the sixth largest in 
the world. 
At the same time, Gov. Gray Davis' 11th-hour, multibillion-dollar attack on 
the crisis starting last winter has so sapped the state budget that 
government fiscal watchdogs say it's even a potential threat to essential 
ongoing programs. 
And despite the effort, analysts say California appears headed toward just 
what Davis and legislative leaders most feared -- major rate hikes that would 
eat into consumers' budgets and a summer filled with rolling blackouts that 
endanger people and pummel businesses. 
""These were the sort of things we said would happen unless the governor and 
lawmakers started taking actions beyond what they've been willing to take,"" 
Sweeney said. 
But the state's quest to ease the energy price and supply crisis amid a 
tangle of powerful, competing interests has turned into such a roller coaster 
ride of ups, downs and surprises that increasing clashes and frustration are 
slowing or even derailing proposed remedies. 
By default, experts say, the utilities may wind up in bankruptcies that throw 
the energy crisis and California's fate largely to the federal courts. 
Signs of trouble abound: 
Rolling blackouts during two spring days earlier this week were caused in 
part by small generators shutting down after utilities missed making payments 
for months. Many view the outages, the first since January and the first to 
strike Southern California, as a harbinger of summer woes despite attempts to 
foster greater conservation and build power plants. 
Though there have been lurches toward an agreement, negotiators apparently 
remain substantially apart in secret talks on a state plan to financially 
rescue nearly bankrupt utilities. 
Major stakeholders in the energy crisis, and their court cases, continue to 
threaten the utilities with bankruptcy at any time. 
The fiscally ailing utilities continue to seek rate increases from state 
regulators -- a move that politicians fearing voter backlash oppose but 
energy and economic experts support as the quickest way out of the crisis. 
With the state's bill for short-term power buys hitting $4 billion, some 
lawmakers are resisting the administration's requests for additional funds. 
The governor, who has declared a state of emergency, has the authority to tap 
funds on his own but fears the political fallout. 
Long-term power contracts negotiated by the state won't cover as large a part 
as hoped of California's demand for electricity until 2004, indicating that 
the state will be forced to seek power for some time on the costly short-term 
market. 
Many more power generators, frustrated at not being paid by the utilities, 
may either cease operations or start selling out of state. 
There remains little sign that federal regulators will order tough wholesale 
price caps, though there are now indications they may pressure generators to 
rebate some alleged overcharges. Numerous government investigations are 
looking into allegations of price gouging. 
Critics are balking at secrecy shrouding the Davis administration's costly, 
short-term power buys to thwart rolling blackouts, purchase of long-term 
contracts and utility bailout talks. Officials say the secrecy is needed to 
avoid skewing the market. 
Some critics say the state is failing to address natural gas supplies and 
costs, an underlying cause of the crisis. Republican lawmakers have futilely 
called for a special legislative session, as was convened on power woes, to 
address the issue. 
Municipal utilities, including Alameda, Palo Alto, Lodi and Santa Clara, say 
they are tired of being asked to participate in rolling blackouts. And 
they've provided power to the grid, for which they haven't been repaid. 
Nowhere recently has the tension over the crisis emerged more publicly than 
in the Legislature, where thwarting utility bankruptcies has been the mantra 
of the administration and legislative leaders for months.Lawmakers' outrage 
But several lawmakers were outraged earlier this week as they battled 
utilities' reluctance to repay the state or small generators for power. 
""Let'em go belly up,"" said Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""I 
don't care anymore."" 
Sen. Debra Bowen, chair of the Senate energy and utilities committee, said 
she felt ""the legislative equivalent of road rage"" at Pacific, Gas and 
Electric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison. 
The utilities, trapped between skyrocketing electricity prices and capped 
retail rates, amassed $14 billion in debts that left them teetering on the 
edge of bankruptcy, unable to buy power. The state has spent $4 billion 
brokering power sales as it works on a rescue plan for the utilities.$50 
million daily 
But negotiations on a bond-backed bailout of the utilities appear stalled. In 
the meantime, the state is continuing to broker power sales on their behalf 
at the staggering cost of about $50 million daily. 
Controller Kathleen Connell earlier this week blocked what she described as 
Davis' effort to tap billions more in state money for the energy crisis, 
saying such a transfer of funds could leave California short of cash for 
essential services such as public schools. 
Since the state started making emergency power buys in January, the budget 
surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said. 
Likewise, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative 
Budget Committee, has warned the Davis administration that he will try to 
block additional funds for emergency, short-term power purchases. 
Peace wants to see the state Public Utilities Commission make progress toward 
recovering from utilities the money that already has been spent. 
The state budget also is being endangered by slow progress toward issuing 
bonds that are intended to repay coffers for short- and long-term power buys, 
according to Connell. 
The delay is due in part to action by the utilities, which are appealing a 
ruling by the PUC that essentially ensures the state will be repaid. 
In the face of myriad signs of trouble, Davis asserts that he is making 
steady, certain progress toward solution of the crisis. 
But Davis' aides privately acknowledge that his fate is inevitably tied to 
his handling of the crisis.Jones'opportunity? 
A potential Republican opponent during Davis' re-election bid next year, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is pressing what he views as an opportunity 
big enough to drive his campaign through in 2002. 
Under Davis' leadership, Jones said, California is ""essentially mortgaging 
our future for our children and grandchildren."" 
Meanwhile, consumer advocates are still threatening a 2002 initiative that 
would overturn rate increases and any taxpayer-financed bailout of 
investor-owned utilities. 
""Davis has not taken the action that is needed to solve this problem,"" said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""Unless 
he does, he's finished.""

Experts predict summer outages Some say conserving not enough
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
For months, the brains guiding California's approach to resolving the state's 
energy crisis have been focused on getting through the summer. 
They now must be wondering if they will make it through the spring. 
California was plunged deeper into crisis last week on a variety of fronts as 
authorities escalated their claims that hugely profitable power companies are 
largely to blame. 
Two days of widespread rolling blackouts. Small generators shutting down 
because they have not been paid, and state legislators unable to agree on how 
to bring them back. Accusations that big generators have overcharged 
billions. State officials scrambling to protect a once-generous surplus that 
is hemorrhaging. The revelation that Gov. Gray Davis' efforts to secure 
long-term contracts for cheap electricity have so far fallen short of 
expectations. 
All in all, one hell of a week. 
And this is supposed to be the easy time of year. 
The state's energy crisis is deepening. Positions are hardening, and the way 
out of this mess has never looked so difficult. 
But it is the coming summer months, when peak demand for electricity will be 
50 percent higher than it is now, that is of greatest concern to policymakers 
and energy officials. 
Most experts agree that there is a bona fide shortage of electricity; 
official state estimates are in the range of 5,000 to 7,000 megawatts in the 
summer, or enough to power 5 million to 7 million homes. 
The California Energy Commission says, however, that with strong conservation 
efforts and new power plants, blackouts can be averted. 
Others are not so optimistic. 
An influential East Coast energy consulting firm recently estimated the state 
will see 20 hours of outages in the coming months, but others fear it will be 
far worse. 
One industry representative said the number of blackouts would be in the 
dozens. And he said if high wholesale prices have shocked anyone, they could 
double again before summer is out. 
""The prices are going to be more damaging than they are right now,"" said Gary 
Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of 
energy generators and traders. ""I would say in the range of $500 to $600."" 
Consider this: A year ago one megawatt-hour was going for $30. Last summer, 
wholesale prices rose to nearly $150, and that was high enough to drive the 
state's two largest utilities to near-bankruptcy and force a state bailout. 
Today, as the state shells out $50 million a day to keep the lights on, 
prices are at about $300. 
The reasons that experts give for the problems that California faces this 
summer are numerous and many are well-documented. No major new power plants 
built in a decade. A growing, technology-dependent population that is using 
more and more power. Drought in the Pacific Northwest. Growing Western states 
using the juice they used to sell to the Golden State. And now small 
generators are shutting down or threatening to sell out of state because they 
have not been paid. 
But there is also growing evidence that many of the problems are caused by 
generators and traders unfairly taking advantage of a dysfunctional market, 
some analysts said. 
""The other thing that makes this summer a little tenuous is last summer our 
experience with generators and traders timing the market to maximize their 
profit,"" said Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Energy 
Commission. 
Because of mild weather last summer, the highest peak of demand for 
electricity was actually slightly less than it was in the summers of 1999 and 
1998, when electric restructuring took effect. 
And yet it was not until last year that the state's wholesale electricity 
market went haywire. In San Diego, the first part of the state where retail 
rates were deregulated, consumer bills doubled and in some cases tripled 
while the state's two largest utilities began their slide toward the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
A growing number of experts now say generators and traders, beginning last 
summer, began exercising unfair influence over a market where the margin 
between supply and demand is razor thin. 
A dramatic example of how that influence is exercised would be where a power 
plant owner closes a unit to decrease supply and drive prices up high enough 
to make up for lost production with sales from other units. Earlier this 
month, federal regulators accused two companies of doing just that in 
Southern California during April and May of last year. 
More common, experts say, is generators and traders offering for sale less 
than a full supply of electricity so that the state is thrown into a 
panic-buying situation to secure enough electricity to prevent blackouts. 
""What they are doing is perfectly legal,"" Chandler said. ""But what they are 
able to do is put just enough megawatts into the market to keep the prices 
high. 
""From the standpoint of supply and demand, there's enough supply in 
California to meet demand, assuming we get this new generation on line and 
increase energy efficiency,"" she added. ""The unknown is whether the 
generators and traders are going to put electricity into the grid that is not 
being controlled by contracts. That's the unknown."" 
Industry representatives vehemently deny they are doing anything but 
producing all the electricity they can and putting it into the market. High 
prices and shortages, they say, are simply due to the tight margin between 
supply and demand, combined with the high cost of natural gas and pollution 
controls. 
""In a market that's tight, if you have power chasing itself all over the 
western United States, you're going to have high prices,"" said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. 
""We're getting tired of being the public policy piata here."" 
Smutny-Jones and other energy officials say they are convinced they will be 
exonerated, and in the meantime they suggest investigating their activities 
could prove damaging. 
Blaming generators, he said, could lead generators to decide the political 
and regulatory atmospheres are too unstable. 
""The supply that California needs to work its way out of this is not going to 
show up, or if it does show up, it will show up with a significant premium,"" 
Smutny-Jones said. 
Still, accusations of unfair market practices escalated last week when the 
state's grid manager, the Independent System Operator, complained to federal 
regulators that generators and traders reaped $6.2 billion in excess profits. 
Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has been loathe to take 
a strong stance in California, has recently demanded that power companies 
refund tens of millions of dollars for prices the federal body says were 
excessive in December and January. 
""I think the generators have gotten smarter about how to make money in the 
market,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California's 
Energy Institute. 
Borenstein is among those who believe generators are exercising market power. 
Although any given generator might own 5 percent or 6 percent of the state's 
generation capacity, when margins are so tight an individual company can 
spell the difference between keeping the lights on or forcing outages. 
That gives those generators the power to force prices to go up artificially 
high, said Borenstein. 
But even some of the generators' harshest critics acknowledge that the 
problem is not confined to market behavior. 
The shortage is real, experts say. 
And drought in the Pacific Northwest is particularly worrisome, since 
Northern California relies heavily on hydroelectric dams in that region 
during the summer, and transmission constraints will make it difficult, if 
not impossible, to make up for that shortfall with power imports from the 
Southwest. 
""Any time you have more rain in L.A. than in Seattle, you're going to have 
trouble,"" said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman at the California Independent 
System Operator. 
In response to worries about what the next several months will bring, the 
governor has launched an intense, multi-faceted plan designed to avert 
blackouts and prevent a financial catastrophe. 
Davis and other Californians also have urged federal regulators to cap 
wholesale prices before summer. But FERC commissioners and the Bush 
administration have been opposed to price caps, saying they don't work and 
would drive electricity out of the western market. 
And to date, Davis' plans to minimize the damage this summer have not shown 
results. His drive to secure long-term contracts has so far come up short, 
and the keystone effort to buy the transmission lines of the utilities has 
stalled. 
Still to be determined is the success of his efforts to bring more generation 
on line and encourage Californians to conserve electricity at unprecedented 
levels. 
Last year, San Diegans had the strongest incentive possible to conserve 
electricity. They were paying the real market cost of power, and that was 
doubling and in some cases tripling their electricity bills. 
But San Diegans conserved only about 9 percent during that time, according to 
a source at the ISO. What's more, once lawmakers recapped their electric 
rates and removed their price incentive, customers of San Diego Gas & 
Electric immediately reverted to their old levels of electricity use, 
according to the ISO source. 
Davis, meanwhile, is counting on Californians to heed his call for 10 percent 
voluntary reduction in usage with no price incentive at all, except that 
those who conserve an ambitious 20 percent during the entire summer will 
receive a rebate. 
Borenstein said the ISO's information about San Diego's electricity use last 
summer is consistent with what he has seen, but he noted that the price 
incentive was not as clear as it might appear. 
As soon as electric bills soared, Borenstein said, politicians began 
agitating customers to not pay their bills. 
So consumers never really thought they were going to be punished for high 
use. 
He thinks it would be good to raise rates because, he said, that will reduce 
consumption. 
""Rate increases, unfortunately, are not at all inevitable,"" he said. ""We 
could pay for all of this through the state treasury."" 
Either way, he said, Californians will pay.

Calif To OK 20% Rate Hike For Utils Tue - Commissioner
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/24/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission will 
likely approve a 20% rate increase for two of the state's largest utilities 
Tuesday, ending a three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners 
told Dow Jones Newswires Saturday. 
The rate hike would let the state recoup money it spent buying power since 
January, said the commissioners, who asked not to be named. The increase also 
would let utilities start paying small independent power producers on a 
forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, the 
commissioners said.
PUC also may approve a trigger mechanism. The move would allow utilities PG&E 
Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison additional rate increases of 5%, if needed, to 
cover future power costs. Rates could go down if the future price of power 
stabilizes, the commissioners said. 
A PUC administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed order that 
does not support the rate increase and end to the rate freeze. As a result, 
PUC Commission President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue an alternate 
proposal that will call for a rate increase of about 20%, the commissioners 
said. 
Both proposed orders are expected to be issued Sunday afternoon. 
""There is just no way we can extract 10 cents from a nickel,"" said one 
Democratic commissioner, who asked not to be named. ""Unfortunately, we are 
going to have to grant the utilities an increase."" 

SoCal Ed To Present Rate Arguments Monday 

The commission is expected to hear oral arguments Monday by SoCal Ed 
executives regarding the company's rate stabilization plan. When first 
presented to the commission in November, the plan called for a 10% rate 
increase. PG&E also filed a rate stabilization plan at the time asking for a 
similar increase. 
Both utilities argued last November that their costs exceeded their revenues 
because wholesale power prices spiked during the summer. The utilities' 
customers' rates were frozen, but wholesale prices continued to soar, 
surpassing the roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour and 6.5 cents/KWh rate the 
utilities were legally allowed to charge their customers. 
In December, PG&E and SoCal Ed revised their rate stabilization plan, 
requesting rate increases of as much as 30% because wholesale power prices 
failed to stabilize and the utilities were getting deeper into debt. The 
commission denied the request in January and approved a temporary rate 
increase of 9% for residential consumers and 14% for large industrial 
customers. 
PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their 
ratings downgraded to junk-status by Wall Street credit agencies and have 
defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank 
loans. 
Gov. Gray Davis was in Palm Springs over the weekend for a fundraiser, and 
his staff was unavailable for comment. Representatives for PG&E and SoCal Ed 
were also unavailable for comment. 
Earlier this month, Davis told Wall Street analysts that he would not allow a 
rate increase because he feared a ballot initiative by consumer advocates in 
the state, who would call for an end to the state's deregulation law. 
""Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in 
20 minutes,"" Davis said at a March news conference. 

Group Pledges 'Ratepayer Revolt' If Prices Rise 

Harvey Rosenfield, executive director of consumer advocacy group The 
Foundation of Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, promised a ""ratepayer revolt"" and 
2002 ballot initiative if electricity rates are increased. Consumer advocates 
are also expected to testify at Monday's hearing about why the utilities 
should not be permitted to raise consumer electricity rates. 
Legislative sources said the rate increase is needed so the state Department 
of Water Resources, which in January started purchasing power for the 
cash-strapped utilities, can be repaid. Moreover, the utilities can begin 
paying the state's so-called qualifying facilities for electricity. PG&E and 
SoCal Ed have not paid the QFs in full since January, and the companies owe 
the generators about $1 billion. 
In hindsight, one key Democratic state senator said, if the state allowed the 
utilities to raise rates in January, the DWR would not have had to spend 
nearly $4 billion from the general fund buying power. Further, said the 
senator, who asked not to be named, the state would not have had to negotiate 
a deal to buy the utilities' power lines in an effort to restore the 
companies to financial stability. 
""Think about it. PG&E and Edison could have regained access to loans and 
would have been able to restore their credit,"" the senator said. ""We 
ultimately spent more than $5 billion than we should have if a rate increase 
is approved. That's not counting, the billions of dollars more we spent and 
are going to spend on long-term contracts, transmission assets and revenue 
bonds. People are going to want answers and I don't know what we're going to 
tell them.""

Few share Davis' view on rate hike: Even aides predict big power cost boost
By Dan Smith and Amy Chance
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 25, 2001) 
With new threats of fiscal distress descending on California's power industry 
and the state treasury, Gov. Gray Davis finds himself increasingly alone in 
his belief that the state can weather the energy crisis without significant 
electricity rate increases. 
Top lawmakers and other key officials involved in sorting through the crisis 
-- including some of Davis' own staffers -- now believe rates need to rise, 
perhaps to double. And they said the Public Utilities Commission is likely to 
signal that some rate increase is needed when it meets this week. 
""I think the facts finally came out in terms of the magnitude of the 
problem,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""You 
have to get the money from somewhere -- unless you steal it or win a lottery 
ticket ... I don't know how you solve this problem without (a rate increase) 
and I never really saw how you could solve it without one."" 
The assumptions the Democratic governor has relied on to bolster his ""hope 
and expectation"" that rates won't rise beyond the already anticipated 19 
percent increase are rapidly falling apart. 
As the crisis drags on, the state will have to spend far more than anyone 
expected in January for short-term power purchases, long-term contracts and 
the utilities' transmission lines. 
Davis had also hoped the state could strike a deal to rein in the costs the 
utilities pay alternative energy suppliers, but by week's end suppliers were 
balking and previous legislative agreements began to disintegrate. 
On March 7, state Treasurer Phil Angelides had recommended the state 
initially sell $10 billion in bonds to help the state purchase power, saying 
a significantly larger-scale bond issue would increase costs for ratepayers. 
The Senate on Thursday approved a bill it thought would make that possible. 
But by Friday, neither Republican lawmakers nor the Davis administration was 
on board. 
Key lawmakers were told by high-level Davis staffers that the state may need 
to borrow as much as $23 billion -- and raise rates by as much as 60 percent 
to 80 percent above the initial 19 percent to support it -- over the next 18 
to 24 months. 
Davis, meanwhile, was in the Palm Springs area for most of the day Friday. As 
negotiations continued in the stalemated Assembly, Davis attended a campaign 
fund-raising luncheon at a top desert golf resort. His spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, said the governor did not play golf, but attended the event between 
a morning groundbreaking ceremony and a mid-afternoon television interview. 
""It's insane and disgusting at this point,"" said Doug Heller of the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""Governor Davis is unfortunately 
tending to his campaign coffers more effectively than he is tending to the 
state's energy needs. He is double-bogeying his round as governor."" 
One administration source said some Davis advisers have been calling for a 
rate increase for weeks. Maviglio said Saturday that the governor has not 
been briefed on the most current financial models with which his negotiators 
and legislators are working. 
""The governor has not signed off (on a rate increase),"" Maviglio said. ""What 
the staff says doesn't matter. ... There's absolutely no change with what 
he's said all along."" 
But others said it is time the governor confronted the reality of a rate 
increase. 
On Friday -- after his briefing with the administration -- Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said, ""it seems more inevitable that the 
Public Utilities Commission will have to raise rates."" 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, for months a key player in the 
energy talks, concluded a month ago that state 
policy-makers have little ability to influence the price and availability of 
power in the short term. 
""Even if the governor and the Legislature acted in perfect harmony, the 
ability of state government to effectuate an outcome is very, very limited,"" 
Keeley said. ""My guess is the force of events -- the enormity of the 
economics involved in this -- are playing out and that the administration is 
coming to the same conclusion."" 
Angelides said the numbers suggest the state can't survive financially under 
the current rate structure. 
""There's a limit to how much you want to sell bonds to keep delaying 
reality,"" he said. ""At the end of the day the PUC is going to have to set 
rates that allow the state to buy power and the state and utilities to 
recover their costs. It is certainly worth borrowing money to repay the 
general fund, but then you have to ask: 'How many billions are we willing to 
borrow to delay the tough reality of where we are?' "" 
Heller, whose group vigorously opposes any rate increase, said he believes 
Davis is politically averse to boosting voters' energy bills -- but at the 
same time doesn't want to take the steps necessary to crack down hard on 
energy generators, such as seizing power plants or imposing a windfall 
profits tax. 
That leaves the Legislature little choice, he said, but to embrace a rate 
increase as necessary. 
""It's political suicide, but they have to be considering throwing this right 
on (power) bills, and using blackouts as a mechanism to scare us into 
accepting these rate increases,"" he said. ""The Legislature appears to be the 
fall guy for the governor's weakness."" 
Keeley said Davis could help the situation -- and perhaps be viewed as 
courageous -- if he publicly embraced a rate increase soon. 
""It would end the fantasy that this situation could be stabilized without a 
rate increase,"" Keeley said. ""That fiction -- and the effort to maintain that 
fiction -- gets in the way of genuine problem solving.""

Rising cost of purchasing electricity sparks alarm 
Posted at 11:00 p.m. PST Saturday, March 24, 2001 
BY PAUL ROGERS 

Mercury News 

A chorus of frustration, anger and renewed calls for the state to seize 
privately owned power plants echoed across California Saturday, following 
news that the state might have to spend as much as $23 billion over the next 
two years to buy power to keep the lights on. 
``Where do we go from here? How about off the bridge?'' said Sen. John 
Burton, D-San Francisco. 
``Deregulation has been a disaster in California,'' said Assembly Speaker Pro 
Tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz. ``Most of us didn't vote on this, but it is 
our job to clean it up. And the cleanup is going to be awful.'' 
Republicans were equally gloomy. 
``The amount of money we are talking about now is so massive that most people 
are shellshocked,'' said Bill Campbell, the Assembly Republican leader from 
Orange. 
The state's energy crisis reached a new level of anxiety among many lawmakers 
Friday, after top staff members for Gov. Gray Davis told legislative leaders 
that the tab for the state to buy power over the next two years might not be 
$10 billion, a previous estimate, but could reach as high as $23 billion. 
The new projections stem in part from the state's failure to sign enough 
long-term contracts for low-cost energy, to move aggressively on an ambitious 
summer energy conservation plan, and to approve a bailout for Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. 
Sources said the governor's aides estimated the rate increase for consumers 
could be as high as 80 percent to cover the costs. 
`Wildly speculative' 
On Saturday, the governor's office did not confirm or deny the number. 
``There are a differing number of what-if scenarios being played out,'' said 
Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. Maviglio called the $23 billion 
estimate ``wildly speculative.'' 
He said Davis holds out hope that ratepayers might get ``billions of dollars 
in refunds'' from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The state this 
week alleged that power companies have overcharged California ratepayers by 
$6.2 billion. 
And he said Davis still is trying to avoid having consumers' rates go up, 
something many legislators, including his fellow Democrats, now say is 
unlikely. 
Davis appeared briefly on a CNN television broadcast to discuss the crisis. 
He did not say whether rates would have to be raised, or address the $23 
billion price tag. 
The two leading choices are to raise rates for consumers or sell bonds, which 
would be repaid by ratepayers but would cost more over time because of 
interest. 
``It seems increasingly there isn't a will in the Legislature to finance a 
huge debt over time,'' said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ``I would say 
a rate increase is more and more likely, whether or not it is the governor's 
first choice.'' 
On CNN, Davis repeated calls for consumers to conserve power by at least 10 
percent this summer and blamed out-of-state power generators for raising 
rates to take advantage of California's flawed 1996 deregulation law. 
``They have what we need, and they are demanding very high prices for it,'' 
Davis said. ``It has driven our utilities to the edge of bankruptcy and 
complicated our problem.'' 
Davis took a backhanded swipe at San Jose, a city that has blocked attempts 
by Calpine Inc. to build a 600-megawatt power plant in Coyote Valley. 
``Everyone has to do their part. Cities can't be turning down plants,'' he 
said. 
Some were calling for more drastic measures. 
Burton, the president pro tem of the state Senate, said that having the state 
forcibly take over by eminent domain and buy out power plants across 
California, many of them operated by Texas and other out-of-state power 
companies, is looking more possible. 
``If these figures are right,'' he said, ``maybe we just go in and buy these 
generation plants. If we are going to spend $20 or $30 billion, we might as 
well own them.'' 
A bill written by Burton to create a state power authority that could build 
and buy power plants passed the Senate last month and is pending in the 
Assembly. 
Davis broached the subject of an eminent domain takeover of power plants in 
his State of the State speech in January. Since then he has said little about 
the option. 
Instead, Davis has tried to fix a flawed 1996 deregulation law by having the 
state enter into long-term contracts to buy power for PG&E and Southern 
California Edison. The two utilities say they have lost more than $13 billion 
since last summer and now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy because they have 
been forced to pay high wholesale electricity costs, and California's 1996 
deregulation law prevents them from raising rates. 
Consumer advocates on Saturday were unequivocal, however. 
``It's time to get the pitchforks and go to the Bastille,'' said Nettie Hoge, 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``You have to put it 
at the feet of the people who are doing the generating -- the Texas and 
Southern companies.'' 
Hoge said that California residents are in for ``certain blackouts'' this 
summer when energy demand outstrips supply. And with power bills likely to 
rise, she said interest is already high in crafting a ballot measure for 2002 
for the state to take over the power plants. 
``What you have is a huge black hole of generator greed. We have almost 
burned through the state surplus. Somebody has got to put on the brakes,'' 
she said. 
Power producers, however, said that solution would be ill-advised. 
``We would vigorously defend our interests,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman 
for Duke Energy. ``You can't seize property without fair market value. It is 
against the law.'' 
Duke has bought four power plants since 1998, paying $611 million. The 
company has already begun a $1.6 billion effort to upgrade and expand the 
plants, which include former PG&E facilities at Moss Landing and Morro Bay. 
If the state seized the plants, long court battles would ensue. Williams said 
Duke's plants are worth far more than what the firm paid for them, and the 
state would lose tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue. 
Opposition to seizures 
Republicans in Sacramento have opposed seizing power plants, saying it will 
discourage new construction. Campbell said Saturday that if rates have to be 
raised, he favors using the state's surplus for a $6 billion or more tax cut. 
The state Public Utilities Commission is to take up the rate hike on Tuesday. 
So far, the PUC has raised retail electricity rates only 9 percent since the 
crisis began. 
One Democratic leader, Keeley, agreed that costs would be so high for the 
state to seize power plants it might not be worthwhile. He said the state 
should stay the course, and can get by with rate increases, issuing bonds for 
some of the costs and continuing to permit the construction of new power 
plants. 
Keeley also said for the first time Saturday that he is no longer opposed to 
letting PG&E or Southern California Edison go bankrupt. It may be cheaper, he 
said, for the state to take over those companies -- and the one-third of 
California's power they produce -- than continuing to help bail them out. 
Will Davis agree to more radical notions like seizing power plants or 
allowing bankruptcy of the state's venerable utilities? 
One political observer said he will do what the public wants, especially as 
his re-election in November 2002 nears. 
``Gray Davis wants the lights on until the day after the election,'' said 
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the School of Policy, Planning and 
Development at the University of Southern California. ``He is a political 
pragmatist. You do what you need to do.''

Bond may fall short, Davis aides fear
Governor holds out hope of keeping a lid on rates

By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
March 25, 2001 

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis' administration is concerned that a planned $10 
billion bond issue may fall short of covering power costs, and some think 
utility customers will be hit with a hefty rate increase. 
But a spokesman said yesterday that Davis continues to say his ""hope and 
expectation"" is that the electricity crisis can be solved without an increase 
in the existing rate structure. 
""He said there is absolutely no change in what he has been saying all along,"" 
said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. 
Maviglio said the administration asked the Assembly on Friday to delay action 
on a bill that would limit the bond issue to $10 billion while ""some 
cash-flow issues"" are studied. 
A Davis energy adviser, Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, said the 
administration is studying ""various scenarios"" based on payments to small 
generators, long-term power contracts, the price of natural gas used by 
generators and the cost of buying power on the spot market this summer. 
""We wouldn't be good analysts if we didn't vary assumptions widely on our 
inputs to try to see what comes out of them,"" Fichera said. 
Maviglio denied reports that the governor's top aides have concluded that a 
rate increase is necessary. 
""We have one anonymous staff (member) saying that,"" he said. ""I can tell you 
from my meetings the whole staff isn't sold on it."" 
The state began buying power for utility customers in mid-January after a 
failed deregulation plan drove Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison Co. to the brink of bankruptcy. 
The rates the utilities could charge their customers were frozen as the cost 
of wholesale power soared, producing what the utilities say is a combined 
debt of nearly $13 billion. 
The state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month from the general fund 
to buy power, and $4.2 billion has been earmarked for power purchases so far. 
The plan is to repay the general fund with bonds paid off by utility 
customers. 
The state Treasurer's Office had hoped to obtain a $5 billion, short-term 
""bridge"" loan by the end of this month, which would provide funds until the 
$10 billion bond could be issued at the end of May. 
The lawmaker who carried the legislation authorizing the bond issue, 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has said from the outset that a 
rate increase is likely, despite the governor's hope to the contrary. 
Now new estimates of what the state may have to spend to buy power during the 
next two years reportedly are as high as $23 billion. The concern is that 
paying off a bond of that size would force a substantial rate increase. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, was pessimistic about avoiding 
a rate increase as he spoke with reporters Friday after the Assembly 
adjourned for the weekend. 
""I don't think so,"" Hertzberg said when asked if a rate increase could be 
avoided. But he quickly added, ""I don't know yet."" 
The governor wants to use the existing rate to pay off not only the bond to 
buy power, but a second large bond issue to pay off the massive debt of the 
utilities as part of the state purchase of their transmission systems. 
The Public Utilities Commission may consider a proposal Tuesday to reallocate 
revenue from the bills paid by utility customers, giving the state the 
""California procurement adjustment"" needed to pay off the power bond. 
Davis also wants the PUC on Tuesday to order PG&E and Edison to begin paying 
small, non-utility generators in the federal ""qualifying facilities"" program 
that provide about one-quarter of the state's power. 
A number of the small generators have quit operating, contributing to rolling 
blackouts early last week. Edison has not paid the small generators since 
November, and PG&E has only paid 15 percent of what they are owed. 
But paying the small generators, while providing revenue to pay off two large 
bond issues, strains the existing rate structure. PG&E warned Friday that it 
may file a lawsuit if the PUC does not leave enough of the rate revenue for 
the utility to pay its bills. 
The bill that would limit the power bond to $10 billion also contained a 
provision that would no longer require that payments to small generators be 
based on the price of natural gas, which has soared in recent months. 
Small generators who use gas turbines oppose the change, warning that it 
would put them out of business. A third part of the bill would cap the rates 
for businesses served by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
Negotiators meeting over the weekend are expected to place the bond limit, 
the small-generator provision and the SDG&E business-rate cap in three 
separate bills.",2001,07087a38b5a0a9a8acdba7209ce2acf3,67.24294180591488,784,17.0,2.0,58,6.0,12.0,278.48588361182976,4,0.9046188640682921

Blackouts Not Expected 
Today

Bay City News 

Following two consecutive days of rolling blackouts, California's power 
picture looks much brighter today, but conservation is still needed. 
The California Independent System Operator is urging consumers to continue 
conservation measures during today's Stage One Electrical Emergency. 
""The conservation efforts of Californians, particularly Tuesday evening, were 
significant and helped to reduce the duration and impact of yesterday's 
blackouts,'' according to officials. ""The California ISO asks customers to 
continue their voluntary reductions during this time of tight supply."" 
More than 11,500 megawatts of in-state generation remain unavailable with 
power plants completing repairs and needed maintenance. However, several 
generating units returned to service today and the level of imported power 
has increased, boosting the supply. 
""The ISO is cautiously optimistic that customer outages will be avoided 
today,'' according to officials. 
Today's Stage One alert is in effect through midnight tonight. 
Stage One Emergencies are declared when power reserves fall below 7 percent. 
Stage Two kicks in when reserves fall below 5 percent. Stage Three is 
initiated when reserves drop to below 1.5 percent.

Calif State Controller:General Fund Surplus Dn To $3.2B


03/21/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California State Controller Kathleen Connell 
Wednesday said the state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion 
from $8.5 billion in January, mostly because of electricity purchases made by 
the state's Department of Water Resources, a press release said. 
Connell also denied Gov. Gray Davis' request to transfer an additional $5.6 
billion from the general fund to the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties, 
the release said.
Connell noted that, given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power 
purchases, the state would need to borrow $2.4 billion in order to tranfer 
the $5.6 billion from the general fund to the special fund. 
""We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has 
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity 
purchases would put the fund at risk,"" Connell said. 

Connell called on Davis to ensure that the CDWR completes by the end of May 
2001 the revenue bond sales that will be used to buy power and repay the 
general fund. 
She also asked that the CDWR notify her of all power purchases made and 
contracts negotiated thus far and requested that she be told within 7 days of 
any purchases and contracts negotiated in the future. 
Connell also said she wanted to be told within 24 hours of any power buys 
that exceed $55 million and asked that the Department of Finance be directed 
to prepare new general fund cash flow estimates for the next 30 and 60 days, 
and for the end of the fiscal year. 
The state's Department of Water Resources has been buying power since January 
in lieu of Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and 
PG&E Corp (PCG) utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co, because suppliers 
refused to sell to the nearly-bankrupt utilities.

jessicaberthold@dowjones.com 

Gov. Davis' office said, in response to Connell's comments, that the state 
budget was solid and the economy remained strong. 
""We will be getting the money back we've paid for energy and it should have 
no significant effect on the state's finances from the Wall Street 
perspective,"" said Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio.

Davis says regulators will act to pay QFs
Electricity providers insist they need to be paid
By Russ Britt, CBS.MarketWatch.com 
Last Update: 9:45 PM ET Mar 20, 2001
LOS ANGELES (CBS.MW) - California Gov. Gray Davis said regulators will act 
Tuesday on a plan to guarantee that independent power generators are paid.
Independent power producers provide about 30 percent of California's 
electricity from a variety of sources including wind, solar and other 
sources. Because many of the companies, known as Qualifying Facilities, or 
QFs, haven't been paid they've begun to withhold power, contributing to 
blackouts in the state Monday and Tuesday. 
""We are anxious to pay the QFs because they're falling like flies,"" Davis 
said at a news conference late Tuesday. ""If they don't get paid, the lights 
will go out.""
Davis said the state's PUC order will require the state's nearly bankrupt 
utilities to enter five-year contracts with the QFs at rates of 7.9 cents per 
kilowatt hour, or 10-year contracts for lower rates. The structure is similar 
to rates Davis claims he was able to negotiate for long-term power contracts 
from out-of-state generators.

Rash power bill may need fix
By Will Shuck
From our Sacramento Bureau
SACRAMENTO Even as lawmakers lament the slow pace of solving California's 
energy crisis, the cost of haste has cropped up in their first major act, a 
multibillion dollar measure that put the state in the power-buying business. 

AB1X, the highly touted bill that put California in the power-buying 
business, may have been so rashly crafted that it will take another piece of 
legislation to fix it, an influential senator said Tuesday. 
At issue is vague wording that makes it unclear when and to what extent 
Southern California Edison and other utilities have to repay the state for 
buying power. 
State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities and 
Communications Committee, said the bill apparently has left room for utility 
lawyers to argue that their companies needn't repay the state until they have 
covered other costs. 
But Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat who represents downtown and western Long 
Beach, said ""the legislative intent is crystal clear"" that the state wanted 
to be repaid directly for supplying about a third of the power utility 
companies deliver to their customers. 
""We need a cleanup bill"" to set the matter straight, she said. 
Although AB1X illustrates the flaws that come with speed, Bowen said, the 
Legislature can't afford to delay. 
""I think we are much too slow in our response,"" she said. ""But that has to be 
balanced against things we've done in a tearing hurry and then have had to 
fix later."" 
No matter what the Legislature does in the coming weeks, she said, California 
is in for a tough summer, and only determined conservation efforts will put 
much of a dent in a precarious supply-demand equation.

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts 
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
""QFs"" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
""It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs,"" Davis said. ""It's immoral and has to 
stop."" 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
""It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,"" said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. ""The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them."" 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
""We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else,"" said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
""We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county,"" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
""We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

State claims $5.5 billion overcharge: Refunds by wholesale generators sought
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published March 22, 2001) 
In its boldest attempt yet to extract refunds from wholesale power 
generators, the state's grid operator accused the generators Wednesday of 
overcharging Californians by $5.5 billion for electricity since last May. 
The state's Independent System Operator, which manages the state's 
transmission grid, plans to tell a federal regulatory agency today that power 
generators consistently took advantage of their stranglehold on the 
California market to ratchet up prices. 
The federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently 
threatened to order generators to refund $134.8 million for overcharges, 
mostly covering January and February. But those refunds amounted to just a 
fraction of what the grid operator was seeking. The ISO, which has been 
complaining about market abuses for several months, says FERC must do more. 
""We're happy that (FERC) took this first step, but we think there's a long 
way to go,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. ""As 
far as I'm concerned, it's been too little, too late. ... The refunds they 
have acted on (so far) have been minimal."" 
She said the report covers five major power suppliers and 16 other power 
importers. 
FERC Commissioner William L. Massey said it would be improper for him to 
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the $5.5 
billion total, Massey told the Los Angeles Times: ""That doesn't shock me in 
any way."" 
""Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the 
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have 
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,"" he said. 
However, most FERC critics are skeptical that the federal agency, which is a 
strong believer in letting free markets run their course, would order a 
refund anywhere near as large as $5.5 billion -- even though it has found 
that California prices at times have been ""unjust and unreasonable."" 
The big power generators, saying their charges were reasonable, are disputing 
the $134.8 million refunds proposed so far and have vowed to fight the ISO's 
latest effort. 
If the ISO were to prevail, the $5.5 billion in refunds could go a long way 
toward remedying California's energy mess. 
They could help restore the financial health of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison, which have nearly been bankrupted by the 
prices charged by the power generators. They also could ease the strain on 
the state treasury, which is spending billions to purchase electricity for 
Californians because PG&E and Edison can't. 
Sheffrin said her department studied sales made by the power generators to 
ISO, which makes last-minute power purchases to balance supply with demand, 
and the California Power Exchange, the now-bankrupt entity where most of 
California's wholesale electricity was bought and sold until December. 
She said the study made ""very generous"" allowances for natural gas expenses, 
costly air-pollution credits and other factors, including the scarcity of 
electricity. The result was $5.5 billion worth of charges ""in excess of 
competitive costs,"" she said. 
In many cases, the companies used their market clout to submit bids that were 
""way beyond their costs,"" she said. 
""It was insufficient competition,"" Sheffrin said. ""They got away with a lot."" 
She said the refund request isn't just a shot in the dark. FERC, she noted, 
""has already found that prices in the California wholesale energy market have 
been unreasonable. We took it upon ourselves ... to show FERC how they got to 
be so high."" 
FERC proposed refunds totaling $124 million for January and February sales, 
declaring that generators' prices were too high. 
In a separate case the federal agency, for the first time, accused two 
generators last week of taking plants offline to force prices up.

Power solution eludes Davis: Lawmakers grow edgy as crisis drags on 
By Emily Bazar and Amy Chance
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 22, 2001) 
Gov. Gray Davis likes to compare the state's energy crisis to a complicated 
""three-cornered"" billiard shot. 
But as California plunged into another round of power blackouts this week, 
Davis has yet to line up the angle on an ultimate solution. 
The state's short-term power bill is nearing $4.2 billion, and legislators 
are balking at the administration's requests for additional money. 
Getting even the least controversial pieces of the puzzle through the 
Legislature is taking weeks longer than expected. 
While the Democratic governor has insisted secrecy about details of his power 
purchases is necessary to protect the state's bargaining position, other 
state officials are complaining vigorously about the lack of information. 
And critical deals the governor hoped to reach with energy suppliers and 
utility companies are proving difficult to close. 
""I think we all got lulled into a little complacency a few weeks ago. All 
these things seemed to be going along, and the governor was making all these 
warm and fuzzy comments,"" said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. 
""But it only takes one deal to go sideways and we're all blacked out,"" he 
added. ""The governor is running around basically saying, 'Trust me.' I'm not 
sure he's deserving of the trust at this point."" 
Davis and his aides insist they are working around the clock on plans to 
boost power generation, encourage conservation and reach an agreement with 
utilities that will keep them out of bankruptcy. 
The utility plan, they say, is the equivalent of a large corporate merger 
that simply can't be accomplished overnight. Davis notes that earlier 
deregulation efforts might have benefitted from a little more time. 
Although the state has reached a broad ""agreement in principle"" with Southern 
California Edison to obtain its power transmission lines in exchange for help 
paying off its debts, a final, detailed deal has not been reached. The 
initial agreement with Edison was announced Feb. 23. 
And the governor has yet to achieve a tentative agreement with Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co., which is driving a harder bargain over price and other 
elements of a potential rescue plan. 
Joseph Fichera, one of several consultants receiving more than $11 million 
from the administration for advice on the energy crisis, said many people 
don't realize the complexity of the deal they're brokering. 
In their bid to achieve a public takeover of the investor-owned utilities' 
transmission lines, he said, negotiators have to pore over thousands of 
documents related to the transmission lines alone. 
""We are doing what is normal in a transaction of this magnitude, which is 
investigate, document, circulate, redocument, agree, move forward,"" said 
Fichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City. ""The 
governor has put a 'I want this yesterday' fire"" under his negotiating team. 
The negotiator, however, declined to say when he expects final agreements to 
be reached with the companies. 
""It could be days, it could be weeks,"" he said. 
There were signs, meanwhile, of trouble brewing on another front: the giant 
bond sale the state must make to repay the money it has spent so far on 
electricity and to finance future long-term contracts for energy. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Wednesday the utilities are appealing a 
ruling by the state Public Utilities Commission that essentially ensures the 
state will be repaid, a move that he said threatens to delay the sale 
indefinitely. 
""If the utilities have decided to adopt a scorched earth policy until they 
get what they need and want, then it will be a significant problem,"" 
Angelides said. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the governor is simply placing too many demands 
on a rate structure that doesn't compensate the utilities for their current 
costs. 
""Political rhetoric is not going to change the math,"" he said. 
In the Legislature, lawmakers are growing grumpier. Most were taken by 
surprise Monday when blackouts were ordered across the state, weeks before 
summer temperatures were expected to set in and strain the power system. 
""I'm more worried than ever,"" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San 
Bernardino. ""A lot of the elements we thought we had a handle on in January 
are unraveling."" 
A deal the governor said had been worked out weeks ago between the state and 
more than 600 small alternative energy suppliers collapsed last week. 
The alternative generators have not been paid by the utilities for months, 
and state leaders attempted to bargain down the price utilities pay those 
generators for power. 
But administration officials complained privately that lawmakers instead 
sweetened the pot for the suppliers to the point that the measure no longer 
helped solve the overall financial situation pushing the utilities toward 
bankruptcy. Under a proposal announced Tuesday by Davis, the Legislature 
would authorize the PUC to require the utilities to pay the alternative 
suppliers at prices more closely resembling the original deal. 
But the governor ran into immediate opposition, as some suppliers said said 
he would not pay them enough to cover their fuel costs. 
""We would go from not being paid, to losing money,"" said Hal Dittmer of 
Wellhead Electric, a Sacramento-based supplier that has been shut down for 
more than a month. ""Almost everybody who burns natural gas is going to shut 
down. (Davis) got it wrong."" 
Democrats outside the Davis administration, meanwhile, are complaining about 
the amount of money the state Department of Water Resources is spending on 
expensive, last-minute power purchases. Within a week, $4.2 billion will have 
been committed. 
State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative Budget 
Committee, is warning the Davis administration that he will block additional 
funds for last-minute purchases of power until the PUC makes progress 
recovering money that already has been spent. He intends to hold a hearing on 
the issue this morning. 
On Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell told Davis she will refuse to 
make a routine budget transfer he had requested, saying she is concerned that 
there is ""no outside check and balance"" on the money the administration is 
spending to buy electricity on the spot market. 
As the statewide elected official who pays the state's bills, Connell said 
she has yet to receive information from the Department of Water Resources 
about how much it is spending. 
""We really need an accounting as to the total amount of liability they have 
accumulated,"" she said. ""I understand they're in an emergency situation ... 
but it begins to imperil the state's ability to manage its cash flow."" 
Meanwhile, a bill to provide $1 billion for conservation programs, aimed at 
reducing power needs this summer, also has languished for several weeks in 
the state Senate. While Davis has focused his attention elsewhere, Republican 
lawmakers have opposed the measure as too expensive. Democrats argue that 
each two-week delay prevents the state from saving as much energy as one 
""peaker"" plant will produce this summer. Peaker plants are designed to help 
meet the peaks of electricity demand. 
""I'm the eternal optimist, but we have to keep working on all fronts,"" said 
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, who hopes to take his energy conservation bill 
up for a vote in the Senate again today. ""It's a formidable challenge.""

Legislators learn some details of power contracts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 22, 2001) 
The veil of secrecy surrounding the state's electricity contracts lifted 
Wednesday -- a little. 
Gov. Gray Davis gave state legislators a report laying out some of the 
details of long-term contracts designed to help the state pull out of its 
energy crisis. But the report left legislators and others clamoring for more. 
""The information raises more questions,"" said Assemblyman George Runner, 
R-Lancaster. ""I liken it to watching a parade through a knothole in a fence. 
You get to look at one float, but you're not sure about what's coming up and 
what you've missed."" 
Davis had previously disclosed that the state had signed or was close to 
signing 40 long-term contracts, at an average price over 10 years of $69 per 
megawatt-hour. 
The contracts are part of the state's strategy for trying to avoid a fiscal 
shellacking in the energy spot market while making sure there's enough 
electricity to avoid more blackouts. 
Davis also previously disclosed that the contracts were for an average of 
about 9,000 megawatts a year, and that the total cost exceeded $40 billion. 
But Davis has resisted telling more, saying the state would jeopardize its 
ability to get the best prices if electricity generators knew what their 
counterparts were getting. 
On Wednesday, the governor's office released a March 15 report from S. David 
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to 
the state Department of Water Resources. The state agency has been given the 
responsibility of making power purchases, and Freeman was brought in to lead 
the negotiations. 
As of March 15, the state had signed 19 contracts with seven suppliers for 
periods ranging from 14 months to 20 years, with many for three or five 
years, the report says. Some of the contracts are for electricity to meet the 
state's everyday power demand, while others are only for times of peak use, 
such as hot summer days. 
The state had ""agreements in principle"" for an additional 25 contracts. 
Runner said he has been told that two of these contracts have since been 
finalized. 
The amount of power provided reaches a peak in 2004 of more than 10,000 
megawatts. As the long-term contracts start to expire around then, the state 
is hoping that demand can be met with new contracts or spot purchases at 
prices expected to be much cheaper. 
The report says nine more long-term contracts were under discussion. 
Some of the contracts are with power generators, while others are with 
marketers who may get the power from a number of sources. 
In some cases, the state may supply the natural gas used to generate the 
electricity, or power costs may be pegged to the going rate for the fuel. 
Some suppliers can cancel if the state fails to sell bonds by a certain date 
to cover power costs or fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating. 
Some depend on the construction of power plants, but Freeman said they were 
firm commitments. 
""We were pretty careful not to put a hope and a dream in the portfolio,"" he 
said. 
More contracts will have to be signed to meet summer demand, and these 
agreements will probably be more expensive, the report says. 
One item not in Freeman's report was a secret deal to relieve several major 
generators from having to pay for polluting the air beyond allowable limits. 
The long-term power contracts include language that would have the state pay 
the costs of ""pollution credits"" that allow power plants to exceed their 
permitted levels of smog-forming pollutants, the governor's office confirmed 
Wednesday. Spokesman Steve Maviglio said that several generators are being 
relieved from having to pay those costs. 
V. John White, a Sierra Club lobbyist close to the negotiations, said Dynegy 
Inc., which has power plants in El Segundo, Encina and Long Beach, is one of 
them. Dynegy officials did not return calls to The Bee on Wednesday. 
Freeman said that generators were demanding hefty premiums for having to deal 
with air quality regulators in the summer and he figured it would be cheaper 
just to pay for the pollution credits. 
In other energy-related developments: 
With more power plants back online, grid operators dropped down to a Stage 1 
electricity alert. The state Independent System Operator was expecting 
supplies to gradually increase over the next few days. 
The state Public Utilities Commission issued a revised draft decision that 
would impose the prices outlined Tuesday by Davis for power produced by 
alternative energy companies -- $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year contracts 
or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years. The proposal is scheduled for a PUC vote 
March 27. 
A federal judge ruled that one of the nation's major electricity generators 
must continue supplying California with emergency power. 
In imposing an injunction on Reliant Energy Services Inc., U.S. District 
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. noted the ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened 
the California landscape"" and said the loss of Reliant's production ""poses an 
imminent threat."" 
Bee staff writers Carrie Peyton, Chris Bowman and Denny Walsh contributed to

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California 




By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 21, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday 
ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California 
despite its fear that it will not get paid. 
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the 
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO 
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try 
to fend off blackouts. 
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water 
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities. 
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by 
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts. 








Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health 
Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power 
? 



The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the 
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law 
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. 
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators ""a tool to 
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."" 
""Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to 
simply ignore emergency orders,"" Robinson said. 
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. 
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three 
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling 
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling. 
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring 
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order, 
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue 
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling. 
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out, 
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for 
roughly 750 homes. 
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant 
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most 
of the power is committed under long-term contracts. 
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it 
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison. 
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June 
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers. 
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part 
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight 
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest. 
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state 
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling 
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed 
the state to avoid blackouts. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also 
imperils California's financial health. 
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is 
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power 
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 
billion, she said. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6 
billion into a ""rainy day fund"" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as 
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its 
power-buying. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. 
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
""The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand 
that kind of audit information,"" Harrison said. 
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the 
$10 billion in long-term debt. 
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress 
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity 
purchases. 
""If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the 
state's finances,"" he said. ""At some point we're going to run out of money."" 
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering 
challenging Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
""Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency,"" he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it 
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with 
wholesalers.

Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health 



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 21, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) California's power-buying on behalf of two strapped utilities is 
gutting its budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk, the state 
controller said Wednesday. 
The surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the state began buying 
electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, 
to $3.2 billion now, Kathleen Connell estimates. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Gov. Gray Davis 
is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
Wednesday marked the first time in three days the state avoided rolling 
blackouts. Power grid officials credited cooling temperatures and the 
completion of repairs at several power plants. 
Connell said the energy crunch now imperils the state's budget as well as its 
electric grid. 
California has been spending about $45 million a day ) $4.2 billion so far ) 
to buy power for Edison and PG&E, both denied credit by electricity 
wholesalers. 
The two utilities, California's largest, say they are nearly $14 billion in 
debt due to soaring wholesale power costs the state's deregulation law blocks 
them from recovering from customers. 
Meanwhile, the state has faced high natural gas costs and a tight power 
supply driven in part by power plant repairs in California and scarce 
hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. 
Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power 
purchases and chastised Davis, the Legislature and state regulators for not 
taking more aggressive steps to assure the utilities can pay their bills. 
On Wednesday, Connell said she is refusing a request by Davis and the 
Legislature to transfer $5.6 billion into a ""rainy day fund"" she said was set 
up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 billion in 
revenue bonds to cover its power-buying. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely

and required by law. 
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
""The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand 
that kind of audit information,"" Harrison said. 
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the 
$10 billion in long-term debt. 
Connell said the scope of the proposed transfer is unprecedented and amounts 
to a ""shell game"" that disguises the power purchases' impact on the state 
budget. 
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress 
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity 
purchases. 
""If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the 
state's finances,"" he said. ""At some point we're going to run out of money."" 
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering 
challenging Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. He said his 
plan may involve giving the utilities low-interest loans with their 
transmission lines held as collateral. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
""Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency,"" he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it

Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power 



By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 21, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) The state's two largest utilities will be ordered to pay 
environmentally friendly power generators in advance, a move Gov. Gray Davis 
hopes will bring a quick end to the power blackouts that darkened California 
this week. 
The statewide blackouts that stretched from San Diego to Oregon on Monday and 
Tuesday were caused in part by the failure of Southern California Edison and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay millions of dollars they owe ""qualifying 
facilities"" or QFs, Davis said. 
Such suppliers use cogeneration ) steam from manufacturing plus natural gas ) 
or solar, wind and other renewable energy to generate electricity. This week 
California lost about half the power those generators normally provide. 








Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health 
? 



Several of them said they hadn't been paid by Edison and PG&E in weeks and 
can't afford to keep operating their plants. 
Davis accused the utilities of taking in money from customers while failing 
to pay the QFs. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since 
January to buy power for customers of Edison and PG&E, which are so 
credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them. 
""It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not 
pay the generators,"" the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday 
evening. ""They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop."" 
PG&E called the governor's statements ""inappropriate and unjustified,"" adding 
that it was negotiating a payment plan with the QFs. Edison said it is intent 
on paying creditors and working with the California Public Utilities 
Commission to pay QFs for future power sales. 
Controller Kathleen Connell warned Wednesday that the state's $2 
billion-a-month power purchases are jeopardizing California's budget. 
The state's budget surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the 
power purchases began, to $3.2 billion now, Connell estimates. She blamed 
Davis for withholding key financial information, and ordered an audit of the 
state's power spending starting next week. 
She blocked a request by the Legislature and Davis administration to transfer 
$5.6 billion from the state's general fund into a special ""rainy day"" fund, 
saying that would have left the general fund $2.4 billion in debt. 
The Legislative Analyst's Office said such transfers are routine; Connell 
agreed, but said the size of the transfer is unprecedented. 
""We started this year with a generous budget surplus,"" Connell said. ""The 
energy crisis has taken much of that away and this transfer on top of the 
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk."" 
Meanwhile, keepers of the state's power grid were optimistic California would 
get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts. Two plants 
down for repairs returned to service. 
Several power plants that were taken down for repairs are also expected come 
online by the end of the week, reducing the likelihood of blackouts, said Jim 
Detmers, ISO vice president. 
Power may flow to homes and businesses, but it could soon cost consumers 
more, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, one of the Legislature's leaders on 
energy issues. 
""I think it's intellectually appropriate and honest to tell people as soon as 
it's apparent"" that a rate increase is warranted, the Boulder Creek Democrat 
said Tuesday, indicating that time had come. 
He estimated that the state Public Utilities Commission may soon have to 
raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities' 
bills. 
""My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able 
to plan for it,"" he said. ""They don't have to like it but I think they'll 
appreciate it."" 
Davis said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills 
without further rate increases for Edison and PG&E customers. 
In the meantime, the Independent System Operator, keeper of the grid, is 
counting on continued conservation by residents and businesses to avoid more 
blackouts. Conservation accounted for about 300 megawatts in savings during 
Tuesday's peak usage, enough to power 300,000 homes. 
Roughly a half-million homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday's 
blackouts, which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into 
darkness across the state. 
The outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until about 2 
p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at least 
one serious traffic accident. 
Two cars collided at an intersection in the Los Angeles suburb of South El 
Monte where the traffic lights were out. Two people were seriously hurt, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Nick Vite. 
In San Francisco's Chinatown, souvenir shops normally bustling with visitors 
were forced to shut down. Nearby, irritated customers waited for a bank to 
reopen. 
The blackouts, like Monday's, were caused by a combination of problems, 
including unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the 
Pacific Northwest and numerous power plants being shut down for repairs. 
Adding to those troubles, the state lost about 3,100 megawatts from the QF 
plants. 
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, estimated 
Tuesday that Edison has amassed more than $1 billion and PG&E more than $2 
billion that they have not paid to generators. 
Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the 
utilities to pre-pay their future QF bills. 
PG&E said its prepayments hinge on an upcoming PUC decision on whether the 
utility's rates are sufficient to pay its bills and cover the state's power 
purchases on its behalf, which amount to $4.2 billion since early January. 
Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to 
climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation 
law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers.

Energy Overcharge of $5.5 Billion Is Alleged 

Power: Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, the state grid 
operator says, citing evidence of market manipulation. Suppliers deny the 
accusation. 

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers 

?????Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5 
billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the 
state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid 
operator said Wednesday.
?????Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of 
bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California 
Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings 
support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional 
revenue by manipulating the market.
?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation.
?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is 
central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers 
excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis.
?????""This might be the first time we told them the total impact and 
magnitude [of the overcharging],"" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of 
market analysis. ""We think the entire amount deserves consideration for 
refunds.""
?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity 
sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of 
the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities 
engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices:
?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices, 
even though they could have made some money selling more electricity.
?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid 
at all.
?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their 
electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average 
markup in August was 100% during peak hours.
?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which 
oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to 
comment Wednesday, saying, ""This is part of an ongoing proceeding.""
?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission 
actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to 
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the 
$5.5-billion total, Massey said: ""That doesn't shock me in any way.""
?????""Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the 
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have 
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,"" he said.
?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market, 
previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and 
January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds 
of only a tiny fraction of that amount.
?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy, 
Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus 
16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
?????""All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate 
amounts,"" Sheffrin said.
?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each 
company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will 
be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how 
much information about the companies will be made public.

?????State, U.S. Investigations
?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power 
in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and 
federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in 
May.
?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California 
market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or 
through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices.
?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is 
confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were 
justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company.
?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units 
so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants. 
These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the 
state.
?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically 
don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds 
they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of 
the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law.
?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from 
buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers 
charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the 
listing price in a hot real estate market.
?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the 
power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by 
FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula 
Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company.
?????""FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are 
made,"" Hill-Collins said. ""This is just a process of justification, not 
necessarily proof of guilt.""
?????Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take 
generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or 
refund $10.8 million to California utilities.
?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California 
Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by 
Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and 
most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state 
Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for 
the three big utilities' 27 million customers.
?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at 
UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies 
exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices.
?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said 
Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices 
in 2000.
?????""We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive 
pricing,"" he said. ""When the market was tight this summer, they were able to 
push up prices, and they did.""
?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found, 
appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per 
megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in 
September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and 
December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used 
to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels.
?????""There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,"" Sheffrin 
said. ""Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted 
itself.""
?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred 
between May and November.
?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to 
refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in 
February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430 
per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight 
that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough 
electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.)
?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69 
million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour.
?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were 
limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because 
the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more 
than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny.
?????""We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is 
Stage 3 alerts,"" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member 
board (two seats are vacant).
?????Generators ""have been given the free and clear,"" he said.
?????""These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are 
almost a joke,"" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the 
Utility Reform Network.

?????Resisting Price Caps
?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can 
no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what 
the market will bear.
?????""FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers' 
own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have 
shown the contrary,"" Sheffrin said. ""We feel FERC needs to look at the 
premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based 
rates.""
?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable 
electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market 
dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting 
firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation.
?????Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to 
use caps across the West as a ""temporary timeout.""
?????Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference 
Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to 
cope with California's energy crisis.
?????""If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and 
they'll be worse,"" Abraham said.
?????Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff 
recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal 
includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting 
of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to 
costs.

Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount 

Energy: Officials say summer prices will be high, and a state report shows 
that contracts with generators are far short of goals. 

By DAN MORAIN and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers 

?????SACRAMENTO--California's fragile electricity system stabilized 
Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because 
the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on 
the costly and volatile spot market.
?????After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut 
down were cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the 
statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency.
?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut 
down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them.
?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high 
cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will 
block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an 
account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity.
?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis 
and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts 
for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to 
7,000 megawatts previously claimed.
?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report 
notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons, 
including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by 
July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but 
none have yet been issued.
?????""We are exposed enormously this summer,"" Senate Energy Committee 
chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report. 
""We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be. 
We don't have a power fairy.""
?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall 
significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the 
state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many 
times those of long-term contracts.
?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist 
who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested 
that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the 
state will need this summer.
?????""We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of 
2003,"" he said.
?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost 
of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern 
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed 
billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the 
spot market.
?????Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with 
generators, said the report represents a ""work in progress."" He said the 
state may yet sign new contracts.
?????However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have 
been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless 
serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately.
?????Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched 
to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their 
energy at times of low demand.
?????The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that 
promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on 
Wednesday.
?????""The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this 
summer,"" foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter.
?????He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances 
and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts 
with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign 
new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest 
and cleanest source of new supply.
?????Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay 
the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November. 
But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little 
incentive to turn on their generators.
?????Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the 
electricity consumed in California.
?????Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal 
sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of 
natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan, 
which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs.
?????Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small 
generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication 
to gamble on future prices.
?????The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal 
next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they 
agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 
years.
?????""The price of natural gas is higher than that,"" said Marty Quinn, 
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC, 
which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. ""If we operate, 
we'll lose money.""
?????Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The 
company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its 
contracts with the utility.
?????A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a 
small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued 
Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market. 
CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since 
November.
?????A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with 
its suit despite Davis' proposal. ""We've had promises before,"" he said.
?????In other developments:
?????* A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of 
Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during 
emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully 
reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S. 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case.
?????* Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion 
because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She 
criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state 
finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of 
Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power.
?????Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic 
governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles 
mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. A Connell aide scoffed 
at the notion.
?????* Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she ""never has had a response"" 
from President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to 
discuss the California energy crisis.
?????In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she deplored 
the fact that ""huge, huge profits are being made"" in the California crisis, 
and said ""an appropriate federal role"" would be to guarantee a reliable 
source of power until the state can get nine new generators online.

Net Complex A Dilemma For San Jose 
SERVER FARM: Plant would tax grid 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/22/M
N236772.DTL 
San Jose, while trying to block construction of a new power plant, is set to 
approve a vast computer complex that could overwhelm California's already 
strained power grid. 
City officials gave preliminary approval last week to what would be the 
world's largest ""server farm."" The sprawling facility to handle Internet 
traffic would drain about 150 megawatts of power from the state electricity 
grid. 
If granted final authorization on April 3, the $1.2 billion project would add 
the equivalent of about 150,000 homes to California's power system, which was 
hit this week by rolling blackouts as demand for juice outstripped available 
supply. 
The server-farm issue highlights a vexing dilemma for the state. 
On the one hand, Gov. Gray Davis is calling for widespread conservation to 
help California overcome its current troubles. On the other, no one wants to 
curtail growth of the high-tech industry, which is an engine for economic 
vitality. 
""San Jose will make a lot of money from this project,"" said Craig Breon, 
executive director of the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society. ""But to not 
help the state out of its energy situation, there's a fair amount of 
hypocrisy going on."" 
The server farm would be owned by U.S. DataPort, a San Jose data-management 
firm. As planned, it would occupy 10 buildings on more than 170 acres in the 
city's Alviso area. 
Total projected energy use would be 180 megawatts. About 30 megawatts would 
be generated by a small on-site facility, and the rest would have to be 
provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
""We're confident that the DataPort project will be approved because it's very 
important to San Jose and to the local economy,"" said San Jose Mayor Ron 
Gonzales. 
But PG&E already is saying that its power cupboard is bare. The utility ""does 
not have sufficient existing electric infrastructure"" to meet U.S. DataPort's 
needs, it said in a recent letter to San Jose officials. 
John Mogannam, U.S. DataPort's senior vice president of operations, countered 
that it could take as long as five years for the server farm to grow big 
enough to require the full 150 megawatts from the state grid. 
""Hopefully, by then the whole energy crisis will pass by, and we won't have a 
problem,"" he said. 
Mogannam stressed the positive aspects of the project, such as its ability to 
handle about 15 percent of global Internet traffic, the 700 jobs it would 
create, and the $70 million over 10 years it would generate for San Jose in 
property and utility taxes. 
""That's why the city likes it,"" he said. 
Indeed, San Jose officials are so enamored with such developments that they 
have all but turned a deaf ear to warnings that the server farm will 
exacerbate California's already dire power shortage. 
Andrew Crabtree, the city's senior planner, said the planning commission had 
barely touched the question of energy supply when it approved the server farm 
last week. 
""It wasn't incumbent on the commission to solve the state's energy-supply 
problems,"" he said. 
Rather, San Jose city planners focused on the environmental ramifications of 
the proposed facility, including air pollution from diesel generators and the 
impact on nearby wildlife. 
How it would affect dozens of burrowing owls in the area was a key topic of 
discussion. 
""We all recognized that there's a power shortage,"" Crabtree said. ""But we 
couldn't do anything about that with this project."" 
Except to make things tougher, of course. 
Server farms run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are an aspect of the 
high-tech boom that was never foreseen by energy experts, and which are now a 
major contributor to California's surging electricity demand. 
A server farm essentially is a large building filled with computers. Each 
computer handles the Web site or Internet traffic for hundreds of corporate 
clients that do not have the technical resources to look after such things 
in- house. 
Most server farms consume between 10 and 60 megawatts of power. At 180 
megawatts, the U.S. DataPort facility is billed as the most extensive data 
center on the planet. 
""There won't be another this size anywhere in the world,"" said Mogannam, the 
company's senior vice president. ""This will be the biggest."" 
With such a vast scale, however, comes additional concerns. For example, all 
that hardware will generate huge amounts of heat, requiring powerful air 
conditioners running around the clock to keep things cool. 
Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator, which 
oversees California's electricity network, said server farms had ""a big 
impact"" on the state's tight energy supply. 
""We have an economy that's increasingly based on delivery of information,"" he 
observed. ""We certainly need to make sure we're building adequate generation 
and transmission to get it there."" 
As it stands, no major power plants have been built in California for the 
past 12 years, while dozens of server farms have sprung up throughout the 
state. 
The Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm, estimates that the amount of 
space taken up by server farms nationwide rose to 9 million square feet from 
1999 to 2000. 
By 2003, it expects that figure to increase to 25 million square feet, or 
enough room for more than a hundred 10-story office buildings. 
San Francisco may be the exception. Supervisor Sophie Maxwell proposed 
interim zoning controls last week that would require server farms to receive 
special permission from City Hall to operate. 
San Jose, for its part, has no such reservations. It does, however, draw the 
line at big, fat power plants in the backyard of the city's leading corporate 
citizen. 
Gonzales is spearheading opposition to a proposed 600-megawatt generating 
facility in Coyote Valley because of its proximity to a residential area at 
the site of a planned Cisco Systems office complex. 
""There's plenty of opportunities to generate power in the city,"" he said. 
""This project is just in the wrong site."" 
The matter is now in the hands of the California Energy Commission, which is 
expected to issue a ruling by May. 
Cisco, critics say, twisted the mayor's arm to fight the plant because it did 
not want a generating facility in its neighborhood. The area will be home to 
thousands of well-heeled tech workers. 
""It's politics,"" said Breon at the Audubon Society. ""City officials are 
making political decisions rather than good planning decisions."" 
Ted Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a 
grassroots organization, is calling for a moratorium on construction of all 
new server farms in the South Bay until sufficient power can be found to keep 
them running. 
""Until they figure out how to build these things without draining the 
electricity grid even dryer it is, they shouldn't build them,"" he said. 
""The Internet industry is creating unintended consequences that will really 
screw up our future,"" Smith added. ""They are so busy focusing on next 
quarter's profits that they don't stop and think about the consequences."" . 
. 
SOME FAST FACTS ABOUT 'SERVER FARMS'
. 
-- What are they? ""Server farms"" are facilities dedicated exclusively to 
housing powerful computers for Internet use. 
-- Who uses them? Companies and individuals pay server farms to maintain 
their Web sites, handle Net traffic and store vast amounts of data -- 
functions that otherwise would require extensive hardware and technical 
support. 
-- Why do they use them? As Internet use explodes, server farms play an 
increasingly vital role in managing data and keeping information moving. 
-- What's the problem? Server farms drain considerable amounts of electricity 
to keep running.

Contracts Won't Meet Summer Demands 
DETAILS: 2004 before full impact felt 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL:

N230640.DTL 

Sacramento -- Long-term power contracts negotiated by the state won't cover 
California's entire demand for electricity until 2004, according to newly 
released details about the agreements. 
The information suggests that California might have to scrounge for 
electricity on the high-priced spot market for a couple more years even as it 
continues to push conservation efforts and construction of more generating 
plants. 
Details of the agreements released by Gov. Gray Davis' administration show 
that the contracts will provide for just over a third of the state's demand 
for power this year. Energy secured by the contracts will grow to meet the 
expected demand in three years. 
Short-term purchases of power have at least temporarily depleted the state's 
budget surplus and have raised the possibility of sharp rate increases 
sometime in the future for electricity customers. 
Davis administration officials are banking on the hope that conservation 
efforts and increased generating capacity will cover the shortfall along with 
purchases of electricity on the spot market. 
""We're facing an extreme challenge still this summer,"" said Severin 
Borenstein, head of the University of California at Berkeley Energy 
Institute. ""Signing contracts doesn't create more electricity."" 
The information released did not include the names of companies that the 
state has signed contracts with or the purchase prices. 
The sketchy details did not satisfy frustrated lawmakers, who said many 
questions remain, especially how much the state will end up paying under the 
terms of the contracts. 
""The fundamental question is how much is it costing the state of California 
to keep the lights on,"" said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks. 
""What we really need is total disclosure."" 
The state started buying power in January, after generators began refusing to 
provide electricity to the state's investor-owned utilities. Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say they have more than $13 
billion in past debt. 
The state has been spending $49 million a day on power purchases since Jan. 
17, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle last week. 
Those documents said the average price of the contracts across 10 years is 
$69 per megawatt hour, including summer peak. The five-year average price is 
$79 per megawatt hour. 
According to one chart provided by the governor's office yesterday, the 
long-term contracts will fall about 35 million megawatt hours short in 2002. 
Based on the average price per megawatt hour the state has been paying since 
January, that could end up costing between $6.6 billion and $13 billion. 
The law creating the state purchasing authority allowed purchases up to $10 
billion and extends until 2003. 
The governor's office said 21 contracts have been signed and another 23 
agreements that have been reached but not yet signed. 
Several generators have said that they will not sign contracts with the state 
until the back debt by the utilities has been taken care of. 
""We have some real potential problems,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John 
Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Strickland and several media outlets, including The Chronicle, have filed 
public information requests to get more information about the prices of the 
contracts from the administration. 
Releasing the information would jeopardize the negotiations for future 
contracts, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. 
Lawmakers, also frustrated by the lack of information given out by the Davis 
administration, were not given notice that the information was coming, and 
many said it was lost in their mail pile. 
The cover letter was on Los Angeles Department of Water and Power letterhead, 
not that of the administration. The letter was written by S. David Freeman, 
head of the Los Angeles system who was on leave for the month of February to 
help the state negotiate the contracts. 
Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, said the ""ambiguity of the 
information raises more questions than it answers."" 
""It's like watching a parade through a peephole,"" he said. ""He's showing us 
another float, but I don't know what the parade looks like."" 
Blaming the state's purchases of electricity, Controller Kathleen Connell 
said yesterday that the state's cash on hand had fallen from $8.5 billion in 
January to $3.2 billion. Connell ordered an audit of the state's power 
buying. 
Connell said she would block a transfer sought by the Davis administration of 
$5.6 billion from the general fund to the state's emergency reserve account, 
claiming it would lead to a ''serious cash flow crisis."" 
The transfer, however, is not related to the energy crisis. The sum 
represents a routine rollover of unspent money from the previous fiscal year. 
State law requires that money to be sent to a special reserve account for 
emergencies. 
Davis officials acknowledged that $3.7 billion in energy purchases have had 
an impact on state coffers, but they say the state will be repaid once bonds 
are issued in the coming weeks. They also said the state typically has its 
lowest cash reserves at this time of year. That changes in mid-April when a 
flood of income tax revenue pours in. 
""The transfer has nothing to do with energy purchases,"" said Sandy Harrison, 
a spokesman for the Department of Finance. 
""It's not helpful to ratepayers, taxpayers and people who want their lights 
to stay on to have the issue muddied with this sort of inaccurate innuendo,"" 
Harrison said. 
In other developments yesterday: 
-- After two days of statewide rolling blackouts, power grid managers avoided 
outages. Demand was lower because of cooler temperatures around the state and 
supply increased as several power plants completed repairs. 
-- A federal judge in Sacramento ordered a major power generator to continue 
supplying power to California. Reliant Energy Services Inc. had insisted that 
it should not be forced to sell to debt-heavy utilities unless the state 
guaranteed the bills.

California overcharged $5.5 bln for wholesale power 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Electricity wholesalers overcharged California 
$5.5 billion over the past 10 months, according to a report by managers of 
the state's power grid. 
The five companies, among other things, frequently offered electricity at 
prices double what it cost them to produce, concludes the California 
Independent System Operator study, which was published Thursday in the Los 
Angeles Times. 
``All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts,'' said 
Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. 
The Times said the ISO planned to file the study with federal regulators 
Thursday and are demanding that the money be paid back. 
The companies denied the allegations, adding they expect the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were justified. 
The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies' 
behavior during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 
million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. 
Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being 
challenged. 
The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at 
excessive prices, effectively withholding supplies, or by not bidding at all 
when they had generation capability available. 
California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since 
January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by 
electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's 
power-buying is gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making 
emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 
billion, she said. 
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major 
electricity wholesaler, Reliant Energy Services, to continue selling to 
California despite its fear that it will not be paid. 
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys it 
at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend 
off rolling blackouts. 
Such blackouts hit the state twice this week. On Wednesday, cooling 
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed 
the state to avoid blackouts. 
Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power 
purchases and chastised Gov. Gray Davis, the Legislature and state regulators 
for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the utilities can pay their 
bills. 
Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring 
wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from 
recovering the costs from customers. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund'' 
she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 
billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys. Transferring the money 
would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt, Connell said. 
She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it 
amounted to a ``shell game'' that disguises the power purchases' effect on 
the state budget. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to 
demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said. 
Harrison said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid 
with the revenue bonds. 
Connell's criticism of Davis, a fellow Democrat, won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who may challenge 
Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
``Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency,'' he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it 
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with 
wholesalers.

If the power goes off 
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
For most of us, rolling power blackouts are a nuisance. For some people, it 
could mean life or death. 
""In Laguna Hills, cancer patient Ruben Marquez said the blackout interrupted 
and prolonged his dialysis treatment. He was unharmed,"" the Register reported 
on Monday's blackouts, which hit about 1.2 million Californians, including 
100,000 Orange County homes and businesses. 
What can people do to prevent disaster? 
""They and their families should have a backup plan,"" Rebecca Long, 
spokesperson for the Orange County Red Cross, told us. 
""The Red Cross recommends in general that you plan for this as you would for 
any disaster, making sure you have battery-operated radios and flashlights. 
We do not recommend candles for an emergency,"" because of the fire hazard. 
She recommended a Web site: www.prepare.org
People with special health needs, such as electric-powered respirators and 
oxygen machines, also should register with the power company.
""There's a whole classification"" for such persons with health needs, Southern 
California Edison spokesperson Clara Potes-Fellow told us.
""The list is for us to alert them that the power could be discontinued. They 
arrange to have power through other means, batteries or generators. We 
recommend that they have a battery backup of eight hours. Therefore, if the 
rotating outages are one hour, they will have plenty.""
Even though the power company has such people's names, she said, ""we don't 
inform them in advance because we have just minutes from when the Independent 
System Operator,"" which directs where the electrons go, orders Edison to 
implement a power outage on the grid Edison owns. ""By the time it took to 
call people, the outage would be over.""
What's the problem at the ISO? ""We notify as best we can,"" Pat Dorinson, ISO 
director of communications, told us. 
""The object is to keep the lights on. Sometimes it's just a moment's notice"" 
before a blackout. ""It makes [giving more notice] pretty difficult. We're 
looking into ways to make the system better."" 
In the meantime, citizens will have to keep taking precautions.
We can't help noting that free market pricing, instead of politically-driven 
prices, would much more likely make electricity available, albeit at higher 
prices. 
We would expect, too, there would be hardship allowances, donations and 
level-pay plans to accommodate various types of needs.

Socialized electricity 
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
Government control of state power won't add one watt for consumers' use




TOM MCCLINTOCK
Sen. McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, represents the 19th state Senate District 
in the state Legislature. 

In a city where bad ideas never die, Sacramento is once again host to a 
variety of plans for the government takeover of California's power system. 
The private sector, it is said, has done such a terrible job of providing 
electricity that government must now step in to save the day. Thus, the 
Legislature is awash in proposals to spend billions of dollars of public 
money to acquire existing power facilities. Fifteen billion dollars has 
already been authorized for this purpose, and an additional $10 billion is 
pending in the Senate. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Davis is losing about a $1.5 billion a month day-trading in 
the electricity market. The irony is that after the expenditure of as much as 
$25 billion for ""public power,'' not a single inch will have been added to 
the transmission lines, nor a single watt to the generating capacity of 
California.
The root of California's crisis is a catastrophic shortage of electricity. In 
a shortage, prices rise or blackouts occur. To reduce prices and avoid 
blackouts, the only permanent solution is to increase the supply. Merely 
changing the ownership of existing facilities leaves Californians with 
exactly the same shortage, only billions of dollars the poorer for it. 
Government takeover advocates argue that at least a government power 
authority will protect consumers against price gouging and poor management. 
Unfortunately, government power authorities don't insulate against price 
gouging. The biggest price gouger in this entire crisis has been the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power, which was generating electricity for 
$51 per megawatt hour and selling it back to California ratepayers for as 
much as $1,400. 
Nor does a government takeover assure better management. Just a few years 
ago, the LADWP was buried in $7 billion in debt. The Sacramento Municipal 
Utilities District was a managerial laughing stock, having squandered 
hundreds of millions of dollars for a nuclear plant it barely used.
""Say what you will,'' the government takeover advocates reply, ""when push 
came to shove, the municipal utility districts of California are in great 
shape, while the private utilities are a basket case.'' But one needs to look 
at the reason. Ever since the state reorganized the electricity market in 
1996, the municipal utility districts were allowed to trade in a free market, 
while the private utilities were forced to buy power exclusively in a 
Soviet-style power exchange where the highest bid during an hour set all 
prices.
The municipal utilities were able to retain their generators. Government 
forced the private utilities to sell theirs. The municipal utilities were 
able to enter into long-term contracts. Government prevented the private 
utilities from doing the same thing. The municipal utilities were able to 
negotiate the lowest prices available for power. Government forced the 
private utilities to pay the outlandish prices on the government's power 
exchange. The municipal utilities were allowed to adjust their rates to 
reflect the actual cost of power to consumers. Government forced the private 
utilities to sell at astronomical losses.
The final argument is simply an ideological one: that power is just too 
important to be left in private hands. Really? Food is a great deal more 
important and private hands have kept this nation well fed for centuries. 
Picturing the Department of Motor Vehicles running the local supermarket 
should sober even the most euphoric of the government takeover advocates.
California's Independent System Operator is predicting a 6,000-megawatt 
shortfall this summer. When there is no electricity on the transmission 
lines, it really won't matter who owns them. During the hottest hours of the 
hottest days of the year, when as many as 6 million homes are without 
electricity, it may begin to dawn on most people that socialism doesn't work 
any better in California than it did in the Soviet Union.

NEWS 
Bush's Energy Policy Will Backfire, Feinstein Warns / She wants federal price 
controls now
Carolyn Lochhead

03/22/2001 
The San Francisco Chronicle 
FINAL 
Page A.3 
(Copyright 2001) 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., warned yesterday that when blackouts 
intensify in California this summer, the pressure will intensify on the Bush 
administration to explain why it rejected price controls on wholesale 
electricity. 
""If by this summer California is, as anticipated, facing these blackouts, and 
the federal government won't help, I don't think the American people are 
going to be very pleased,"" Feinstein told California reporters. 
Asked if help means the cost-based price controls Feinstein is pushing, she 
said, ""Right now, yes."" 
Feinstein said California Democrats will begin to escalate their criticism of 
the administration, predicting that support will build among Western senators 
for her legislation to impose price caps on wholesale electricity in exchange 
for lifting the rate cap on California consumers. 
If it passes, she said, ""the administration is really going to have to face 
whether they're going to help or not help."" 
Feinstein said House Democrats from the West Coast also told her they expect 
that White House inaction on price caps would help them gain seats in 2002. 
But she refused to speculate on the political fallout from the energy crisis 
against Democrats in California . 
Feinstein characterized Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's adamant arguments 
against price controls as ""recalcitrant,"" saying his statement to a Senate 
committee last week ""essentially said California 's on its own."" 
She speculated that because "" California is dominantly Democratic, even 
somebody like me that works across party lines is beginning to wonder if this 
isn't an unnecessarily barbed stick at California ."" 
White House spokesman Ken Lisaius disputed the charge, saying the Bush 
administration is doing all it can, but can't control that demand is 
outstripping supply. 
""The federal government cannot prevent blackouts, but can only help at the 
margins in situations like this,"" Lisaius said. ""The only thing that can 
prevent blackouts is reduced demand, increased supply and good weather."" 
Abraham has twice in the last week argued strongly against price controls, 
including the cost-based ones Feinstein advocates, saying they could increase 
blackouts by discouraging power sales into the Western electricity grid. 
He also said many power providers, including the federal Bonneville Power 
Administration in the home district of Sen. Gordon Smith, the Oregon 
Republican co-sponsoring Feinstein's bill, would be exempt from federal price 
caps. Feinstein disputed that, but Smith's office agreed. 
Abraham argued that price controls would not work in part because roughly 
half the Western electricity market would be exempt, including federal power 
marketing authorities such as Bonneville, rural electric cooperatives and 
municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
On another front, House Republicans omitted from their budget projected 
revenues from opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and 
gas exploration. 
A Budget Committee spokeswoman said Chairman Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, determined 
that the $1 billion in revenues from the wildlife refuge the Bush 
administration included in its budget were not needed and that there was ""no 
reason to put in something that controversial, that some of our members don't 
even like, when you don't have to."" 
But Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar (Los Angeles County) said House 
Republicans ""are not backing off at all"" from opening the wildlife refuge to 
drilling. ""Our goal is to get it passed in the House,"" he said, saying the 
Budget Committee omitted the revenue projections because the drilling has not 
yet been approved.

Reliant Still In Power Pact Talks With Calif. DWR 
By Christina Cheddar

03/22/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  (This report was originally published late Wednesday.) 
   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) remains in discussions with 
the California Department of Water Resources to sign long-term power 
contracts. 
However, issues regarding the creditworthiness of the agency remain, said Joe 
Bob Perkins, president of Reliant's Wholesale Division. 
""We want to be part of the solution,"" Perkins said. At the same time, Reliant 
is trying to protect itself from incurring additional unpaid accounts 
receivable, he said. 
The DWR has been buying power on behalf of California 's financially troubled 
utilities. However, Reliant has yet to sign a formal agreement with the 
agency because Reliant is concerned it won't be paid. 
During a conference call Wednesday, Perkins said he couldn't comment on a 
lawsuit between Reliant and the California Independent System Operator 
because he didn't know how it was progressing. 
Further court action on the case is expected Wednesday. 
The lawsuit stems from Reliant's desire not to be required to sell power to 
California if the state won't guarantee payment. The Houston energy company 
is concerned that it won't be paid for power being bought by the ISO on 
behalf of Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and 
PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit. 
To date, Reliant is owed ""some $370 million"" from unpaid power sales to the 
utilities. 
Much of Perkins' presentation centered on how the power crisis in California 
emerged. 
Using data from research firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the 
company discussed the imbalance between California 's power demand and its 
power supply. 
Looking ahead to the summer, it isn't a question of whether rolling blackouts 
will occur, but ""how many and how severe,"" Perkins said. 
Low hydroelectric availability, loss of imported power, warm weather, demand 
growth and plant outages could lead to a worst-case scenario in California , 
he said, adding that some estimates predict California could experience 1,100 
hours of power outages this summer. 
The skyrocketing power prices in the region are a reflection of the power 
market's imbalance, he said. 
Reliant submitted only ""economically sound"" bids for power, Perkins said. He 
expects the company can document why it charged the prices it did as required 
by regulators. 
""We have been very rigorous and very disciplined in what we have submitted,"" 
Perkins said. 
He added that retail customer price increases are one way of sending a signal 
to consumers to lower consumption. He cited studies that show a 20% retail 
price increase could reduce consumption by 2,000 megawatts. A megawatt is 
enough power to serve roughly 1,000 homes.

CPUC Must Address Rates In QF Repayment Order - SoCal Ed

03/22/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
(This article was originally published Wednesday) 
   
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Any order from the California Public Utilities 
Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators going 
forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate 
structure, a spokesman for Edison International (EIX) utility Southern 
California Edison said Wednesday. 
The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require 
utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, $79 a 
megawatt hour within 15 days of electricity delivery. The decision will be 
voted March 27 by the CPUC. 
""We're still reviewing (the decision) and should have more to say in a day or 
two. To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of 
course we will. But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs,"" a SoCal 
Edison spokesman said. 
SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are 
struggling under nearly $13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an 
inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate 
freeze. 
Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF 
bills in full since December. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some 
partial payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing. Together, they 
owe the QFs about $1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt. 
An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp comments, that 
the company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors. 
""The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the current rate 
base to pay our bills,"" said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs 
Bob Foster. ""We understand the financial distress (the QFs) face; we are 
facing financial distress ourselves."" 
The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned 
utilities to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power 
for $79/MWh and $69/MWh, respectively. 
The QFs ""may be able to live with"" the PUC proposal, but the five- and 
10-year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the 
California borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the 
Independent Energy Producers Association. Natural gas prices into California 
are currently higher than anywhere in the country. 
But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from 
filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money 
they are still owed. 
""There's still a lot of skepticism. To say our position has changed based on 
the CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate. A lot still 
has to happen,"" said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors 
committee.

Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped
By Jason Leopold

03/22/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
(This article was originally published earlier Thursday.) 
   
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Many of California 's independent power producers 
late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week 
if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators 
charge for electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned 
utilities. 
At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public 
Utilities Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities' 
electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas. 
Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation. 
State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would 
restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit 
Pacific Gas & Electric , Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California 
Edison, and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric from $170 a 
megawatt-hour to $69-$79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas. 
Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because natural gas 
prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California , the state 
wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities. 
The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of 
electricity in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new 
supply contracts with the utilities. 
""For $79/MWh, natural gas would have to be $6 per million British thermal 
unit at the Southern California border,"" said Tom Lu, executive director of 
Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF, generating 
340 MW. ""Our current gas price at the border is $12.50."" 
Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling 
blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is 
expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be 
implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week. 
Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC (BP) and is owed $100 million 
by SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature ""will only 
make things worse."" 
David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, whose 
members supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to 
pay the QFs more than $1 billion for electricity that was already produced. 
 
  State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons 
   
The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total power 
supply. Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired facilities. The 
rest is generated by wind, solar power and biomass. 
About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in 
California because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of 
millions of dollars from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly 
four months. 
Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to 
drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to 
default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates. 
The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable to 
operate their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural 
gas to run their units. Others continue to produce electricity under their 
contracts with the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward 
basis. 
The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity 
grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling 
blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday. 
Gov. Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took 
their units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and 
Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a 
forward basis and set rates of $79/MWh and $69/MWh for five and 10 year 
contracts. He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay 
the QFs for power they sell going forward. 
""After next week the QF problem will be behind us,"" Davis said Tuesday. ""We 
want to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that 
happens the lights go out."" 
But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez, 
D-Shafter, a member of the Assembly energy committee. 
""I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on,"" Florez said in an 
interview. ""Many of these congenerators are in my district. They said if the 
legislation doesn't change they are going offline. This compounds the issue 
of rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt."" 
Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was handing 
the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that 
would have set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign 
individual contracts with the utilities. In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the 
legislation, saying the rates should be below $50/MWh. 
Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to the new 
rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was 
originally proposed. 
 
        QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts 
   
John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee, one of 
a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on 
getting paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want 
to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties. 
""Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties 
(including the state Department of Water Resources) until a resolution to the 
crisis can be accomplished,"" wood said. 
Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in Sacramento, 
which is owed $8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation units 
offline. 
Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business. 
""I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision,"" he 
said. ""The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to 
raise electricity rates. All of this is being driven by an artificial 
construct that California can avoid raising rates.""
